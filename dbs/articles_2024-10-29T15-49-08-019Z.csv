"Tensions continue to build in the Middle East after the Israeli military traded more fire with Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. At least 18 people are dead after an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in northern Lebanon. The attack came after a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli army base left four soldiers dead and dozens of others severely wounded. RELATED STORY | Drone strike in Israel wounds almost 40 as Hezbollah claims responsibility ""Overnight, Iranian proxy Hezbollah conducted a UAV attack against Israel – a brutal attack that killed four troops and injured many more,"" Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement. ""It only further points to the ongoing threats posed by Hezbollah, and the urgency to take every necessary measure to dismantle their attack infrastructure."" On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured the army base targeted in the attack, vowing Israel ""will continue to hit Hezbollah everywhere, even in Beirut."" RELATED STORY | US will send an air defense battery and American troops to Israel to bolster defenses against Iran Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has authorized the deployment of a sophisticated air defense system to Israel, as well as American troops to operate it, even as Iran has warned the U.S. to keep troops out of Israel. And while the new defense system won't be there to deal with Hezbollah drone and rocket attacks, it will be used to address longer range threats from Iran.",
"Iran's oil exports dropped by around 42 percent in early October amid fears surrounding Israeli strike threats likely targeting Iranian oil sites, according to Oil&Gas. Tanker tracking firm data indicated that Iranian oil exports fell to 600,000 barrels of oil loaded per day in the first 10 days of the month, rather than the average 1.4 million barrels per day seen in recent months. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed Iran will ""pay for"" its strike on Israel on October 1, when Iran fired approximately 180 missiles, according to Reuters. Israel is rumored to be considering attacking Iran's oil sites. An oil terminal in Tehran photographed on November 13, 1979. Iranian oil sites are reportedly in danger of being the target of an upcoming Israeli strike in retaliation for Iranian strikes against Israel. An oil terminal in Tehran photographed on November 13, 1979. Iranian oil sites are reportedly in danger of being the target of an upcoming Israeli strike in retaliation for Iranian strikes against Israel. Mohammad Sayad/Associated Press Newsweek reached out to the Iran Ministry of Petroleum for comment via email. Satellite imagery recently showed oil tankers vacating the waters surrounding Kharg Island, Iran's main oil terminal, which some fear may be Israel's target, according to CNBC. Iranian oil exports are expected to remain lower throughout this month and reach a maximum of 1.35 million barrels per day, according to OilPrice.com. Adding to Iran's struggles with oil exports, the U.S. recently imposed further sanctions on Iran's ""ghost fleet"" of ships and companies in the United Arab Emirates, Liberia, Hong Kong, and other locations that transport and aid oil exports to buyers in Asia on October 11. These sanctions follow Iran's strike on Israel on October 1, and U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the sanctions will ""help further deny Iran financial resources used to support its missile programs and provide support for terrorist groups that threaten the United States, its allies and partners."" Anoush Ehteshami, a political scientist and professor of International Relations in the School of Government and International Affairs at Durham University, spoke to Newsweek about how Iran's decrease in oil exports could affect the U.S. politically and economically. Ehteshami said, ""In terms of the U.S.' own energy policy, if anything it enhances Biden's hand. The U.S. is now the world's premium producer, and as it happens, also exporting to lots of places, including Europe of oil products and oil itself and of course, energy as well. So, the less comes out of the Persian Gulf, the more reliant the major economies are going to be on the U.S. In one sense, Iran's isolation in the absence of increased production by the Saudis, the Iraqis, and the Marathis, will mean a growing demand for U.S. production of exports."" He went on to explain that in previous historical instances where Iran has faced oil export crises of this nature, Saudi Arabia has ""loosened the taps"" and ""allow more oil to come onto the market in order to stabilize prices,"" but emphasized that they may not do so in this instance as Iran may see the action as ""pro-American"" and therefore against their own diplomatic ties with the country. Ehteshami did note that Russia, like the U.S., could benefit from Iran's decrease in oil exports, and that he believes Japan, South Korea, China, and India will the consumers who are ""going to be most concerned about any tightening of the international oil markets, because they are the ones who are directly dependent on market fluctuations internationally."" He continued, ""Nevertheless, it's not about Iran itself, to tightening of Iranian export capability that matters. Because oil prices are volatile, and they always tend to have a worst-case scenario outlook down the line, a week, a month, three months, and so on. It's the perception of how American Iranian tensions, Iranian Israeli tensions are interpreted in oil markets that really matters."" Ehteshami also spoke at length about the effects of the U.S.' new sanctions on Iran's oil exports and moreover, the Iranian economy at large, highlighting that it will affect the economic situation ""very gravely."" He said, ""Iran's economy is already on its knees because of sanctions, because of incompetent management, because of cronyism and corruption, and also because, frankly, of lack of investment by much of the world in development and modernization of infrastructure. Oil has been one of the lifelines, and China in particular has been very happy to continue to buy discounted Iranian oil, but this has declined. Ehteshami attributed China's declining demand for oil from Iran to Russia's oil exports, and emphasized that if Iran's oil competitors manage to increase output and meet global market demands, Iran will suffer and it will have heavy effects on the currency, inflation, imports, and ""the country's ability to continue to maintain a general macroeconomic position at home."" This decrease in oil exports follows Iran's previous economic high earlier this year, as Iranian exports hit 1.82 million barrels per day in March, the highest rate in six years, and overall exports of 141.7 million barrels in the first quarter of this year according to Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- An Israeli airstrike on a hospital courtyard in the Gaza Strip early Monday killed at least four people and sent flames sweeping through a packed tent camp for people displaced by the war, leaving more than two dozen with severe burns, according to Palestinian medics. The Israeli military said it targeted militants hiding out among civilians, without providing evidence. In recent months it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent camps, alleging that Hamas fighters were using them as staging grounds for attacks. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah was already struggling to treat a large number of wounded people from an earlier strike on a school-turned-shelter nearby that killed at least 20 people when the early morning airstrike hit and fire engulfed many of the tents. Associated Press footage showed children among the wounded. A man sobbed as he carried a toddler with a bandaged head in his arms. Another small child with a bandaged leg was given a blood transfusion on the floor of the packed hospital. Hospital records showed that four people were killed and 40 wounded. Twenty-five people were transferred to the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after suffering severe burns, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Israel is still carrying out near-daily strikes across the Gaza Strip more than a year into the war, and has been waging a major ground assault in the north, where it says militants have regrouped. The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, while Palestinian militants abducted around 250 hostages. Around 100 are still being held inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. Around 90 percent of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war, often multiple times, and large areas of the coastal territory have been completely destroyed. Israel has ordered the entire remaining population of the northern third of Gaza, estimated at around 400,000 people, to evacuate to the south and has not allowed any food to enter the north since the start of the month. Hundreds of thousands of people from the north heeded Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war and have not been allowed to return. That has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel intends to implement a plan devised by former generals in which it would order all civilians out of northern Gaza and label anyone remaining there a combatant — a surrender-or-starve strategy that rights groups say would violate international law. The plan has been presented to the Israeli government, but it's unclear whether it has been adopted. With no end in sight to the war in Gaza, Israel is also waging an air and ground war in southern Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group, an ally of Hamas that has been firing rockets into northern Israel for more than a year. Israel has also threatened to strike Iran in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack, raising the prospect of an all-out regionwide war.",
"BEIRUT, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese Mission to the United Nations on Monday filed two complaints to the UN Security Council against Israel regarding the repeated attacks on the positions of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the impact of Israeli military actions on the Lebanese education sector. The first complaint, according to the Lebanese National News Agency, considered Israel's request for the peacekeeping forces to evacuate their positions as ""illegitimate."" Lebanon stressed that ""the Israeli attacks on UNIFIL are a dangerous precedent and a flagrant violation of international law and Security Council Resolution 1701."" In the complaint, Lebanon demanded ""a firm and strict stance"" be taken against these attacks, stressing ""the need to hold Israel accountable for these violations and prevent it from repeating them, to avoid casualties among UNIFIL forces, and to ensure UNIFIL's ability to continue fulfilling its obligations stipulated in its mandate."" Five UNIFIL personnel were injured in recent days during battles between the Israeli army and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, where UNIFIL accused the Israeli army of ""repeatedly"" firing at its positions. The Lebanese Mission to the United Nations also submitted a second complaint regarding the Israeli attacks' impact on the education sector in Lebanon. In the complaint, Lebanon urged UN Security Council to intervene urgently and effectively to stop the ongoing Israeli ""aggression"" on its territory, which it said had deprived nearly 1.4 million students of their basic right to education. The complaint called on the international community to ""move immediately to ensure the cessation of aggression and the protection of the right to education as a fundamental pillar for building a stable and secure future for the country."" The Israeli army has launched intensive attacks on Lebanon since late September in an escalation with Hezbollah, heightening concerns about a broader war as the conflict between Hamas and Israel continues in the Gaza Strip. According to the Lebanese Health Ministry, the death toll from the Israeli attacks on Lebanon since the onset of the Hezbollah-Israeli conflict has reached 2,309, with injuries totaling 10,782.

"I srael stands like a steady rock in the midst of choppy seas. Post its retaliation of the 7 October 2023 attacks, it has almost completely destroyed Gaza and 'claims' to have annihilated Hamas as also its ability to wage war. It was also behind the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas in Tehran in July this year. However, recent rocket attacks from Gaza display that Hamas still possesses the capability to strike, though not at the same level as before. This has led to Israel reengaging Hamas militarily. A number of Israeli hostages remain with Hamas. Talks of peace and return of hostages are no longer on the cards. The Hezbollah in Lebanon supported Hamas by targeting Israel with over 8,000 rockets during the past year. Hezbollah is believed to possess around 150,000 rockets. Israel was compelled to relocate almost 100,000 settlers from its northern region bordering Lebanon. Once it contained Hamas, Israel commenced targeted operations against the Hezbollah as per a systematic plan. It initially exploded pagers killing or maiming the group's middle level leaders as also impacting their communications. Next it hit its top hierarchy, including its secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, as also most of its Radwan (special forces) Unit leadership, adding to turmoil within the Hezbollah. Simultaneously, the Israeli Air Force launched concerted aerial assaults targeting Hezbollah's stockpiles of rockets and their launchers. It has been a couple of weeks and Hezbollah is yet to announce Nasrallah's replacement, conveying hesitation amongst its hierarchy to take up the responsibility.",

"Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, was killed during an Israeli military operation, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz confirmed late on Thursday. The October 7 mastermind was the architect behind the October 7 terror attacks last year on Israel, which left some 1,200 people dead and led to hundreds being taken hostage. Those terror attacks prompted Israel's current . The 61-year-old became the political leader of Hamas in after the August in Iran's capital, Tehran. Hamas, which rules over the Palestinian territory of Gaza, is deemed a terrorist organization not only by Israel, but also the US, Germany and several other countries. The Hamas leader was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. He joined Hamas in 1987 shortly after it was founded. Sinwar spent decades in Israeli prisons for killing two Israeli soldiers. During the imprisonment, he read Israeli newspapers and reportedly became fluent in Hebrew. Israeli doctors also saved his life from a cancerous brain tumor and provided him with dental treatment. The 'Butcher of Khan Younis' Sinwar was released in 2011 as part of a prisoner exchange for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Palestinian militants had abducted Shalit in 2006. Sinwar's ruthlessness and zero tolerance for Palestinian collaborators with Israel led him to being called the 'Butcher of Khan Younis.' Following the October 7 terror attacks, there were reports that he spoke in Hebrew with a group of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. wd/ab (Reuters, AP) The post",

"'In place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art.' -Susan Sontag, Against Interpretation Breathing in the crisp air and full sunlight of autumn, I leaf through Sontag's Against Interpretation and Other Essays , seeking respite from the merciless continuity of war and violence mediated via social media: forced displacements; the expansion of the war between Israel and its proxies; news of Hurricane Helene (now Milton) displacing thousands in the southeastern U.S. I think about what it means to live in a society bent on the separation of the psychic and emotional from the political, fundamentally leading into attitudes of indifference. How does one live with constant heartbreak? Sontag's argument in Against Interpretation posits the idea of 'love' for the work of our lives within the framework of erotics, expanding through descriptive rather than prescriptive vocabulary, how we consider art as a means to recover our senses. She upholds the need to stay with art (at all costs) as a means of recognizing our political being through complete presence, undistracted by the world's noise. Contrary to apathy or resistance to forces of an outside world, it is a promise to stay connected through the most excruciating feelings the erotic might offer. As artists, curators, writers, and workers subject to the rubrics of the market, there is something insurrectionary in receiving art simply for what it actually is versus what we are told it is and how it should be . How could a falling out with this historically protracted divide between content and form give way to ideas of transparency and luminosity, to bring us closer to clear and present dangers? Absorbed, I turned to Audre Lorde's 1978 essay, 'Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power,' where she takes on the erotic as a source of inner knowledge, power, and a means of self-affirmation in exceedingly patriarchal and racist environments. Artists, as outsiders, tend to grasp social facts before they enter the field of politics. Barbara DeGenevieve's 'In Your Face' at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago galleries, is a prime example, revealing underlying limits and taboos imposed on hypersexualized bodies as sexual health rights in the U.S. come under fire. In 'Auto Portrait Spectacular,' artist-curator Alberto Aguilar invited 21 artists to exhibit art in their cars as an extension of the American experience. Hosted in the parking lot of the National Museum of Mexican Art as part of the Chicago Humanities Festival, Colombian artists Gabriela Estrada Loochkartt and Pablo Lazala Ruiz addressed the dystopic nature of the American dream, inviting collaborators to take over the body of a U-Haul rental truck. The artists captured multiple discontinuous yet connected realities of immigration: issues of documentation, low-wage and poor working conditions, ethnogeographic precarity, and the apparatuses of faith in a feudal society. Engulfing the vehicle, the project materially realized the polyphonous voice of the outcast. Turning to Sontag and Lorde to adjust my lens to a mode of sensuous viewing through the season, the erotics provided a space for being, listening, viewing, and framing untapped potentials, as artists collectively attempt to push the needle forward on democratic coalition-building leading up to the U.S. election. Installation view, 'Escaping the Tyranny of Meaning,' 2024 Courtesy of the artist and Mariane Ibrahim 1. Leasho Johnson: 'Escaping The Tyranny of Meaning' Reconciling anxieties of queer intimacy and longing, Johnson's first solo presentation at Mariane Ibrahim is an experience in queer Caribbean anti-coloniality and becoming. A shared oppression of nature and queer desire underlies Johnson's riotous distemper, watercolor, oil, acrylic, dye, and charcoal works. Building up deeply felt spaces of social exclusion and fear in the context of transphobic violence in Jamaica, Johnson embraces the coexistence of multiplicitous identities from the abstracted body of enslaved field workers to mythic tales of Anansi to the shared pursuit of deep sea creatures masquerading as swinging Black men. Johnson creates new ways of seeing from a space of Afro-Caribbean vulnerability in an attempt to make visible forbidden axes of sexual intimacy, survival, and misconstrued racial differences in Caribbean and queer communities.

Courtesy Document 2. Tromarama: 'Auto Ally' In their second solo show at Document, Tromarama—an Indonesian artist collective made up of Febie Babyrose, Ruddy Hatumena, and Herbert Hans—draws an arc between everyday subjectivities and the political implications of platform economies in the context of the former global South. Echoing what City University of New York professor Amber Musser refers to as Lorde's 'internal commitment to dislodging the flattening effects of Western, phallocentric, racist epistemologies,' Tromarama generates a sadomasochistic mise en scene. Wall-to-wall magnified, glitched, bruised derma paper wraps the environs of the gallery. A sound sculpture, Sore Sore , clamps 16 horizontal foam rollers to an algorithmically generated binary synthesizer triggered by the use of '#asset' on X (formerly Twitter). Crackling noises of musculoskeletal contractions creep under the skin as the eye moves to a large wall with blinking cupping tools and a large-scale video installation, This Currency Is Spasming Me . Embroidered two-and-a-half cent Nederlandsch Indie coins, now used for muscular scraping, speckle a triumvirate of mosquito nets as projection surfaces. Eyes peep through ruptured planes as thumbs and fingers probe and swipe repetitively. Drawing attention to the anachronisms between lingering digital traces and data neocolonialism that exploits labor in the Global South, the harvesting of big gata in the Global North draws blood to the surface. Deep red and purple bruises on the walls mark power asymmetries between the needs of populations across north/south axes. Carving a wormhole through the rotten apple of the world, Tromarama questions the potential of the virtual as a space for survival, allowing us to peep albeit momentarily at the indestructible ubiquitous enemy other—in part, ourselves.

Lykanthea: 'Some Viscera' for Chicago Performs Upending toxic attitudes and oppressive student-guru dynamics in classical dance traditions like Bharatnatyam and ballet, Lykanthea, led by Carnatic vocalist and dancer Lakshmi Ramgopal, presented a story of femme intimacy and delirium—with moments of diasporic amnesia and maternal longing—through an arangetram on the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago's main stage this September. Fusing Sanskrit and Tamil poetry, Baroque chamber and Carnatic music, and stemming from Indian Rasā theory, Lykanthea produced an embodied rhetoric of art as a sensuous persuasion. Producing an auratic performance split into several acts, the collective brought the emotional interior of social and sexual hybridity to the fore, coloring the stage in lotus pinks, moonlit mogrā (jasmine), and rageful rose reds, tracing feelings of love, anger, loss, and pain at an arm's length from audiences. Drawing outside of the lines of traditional training, Lykanthea takes on the erotic as a source of power and instability to topple interlocking structures of suppression and gender biases at the root of abuse, naming deeper, more complicated emotions than those acknowledged in the name of love. 4. Barbara DeGenevieve: 'In Your Face' A major retrospective for interdisciplinary artist Barbara DeGenevieve, 'In Your Face' opened at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where the artist dedicated a large part of her career. It is therefore no surprise that there is a deep sense of satisfaction in visiting this expansive survey, poured over by her colleagues Alan Labb and Lisa Wainwright for nearly a decade. DeGenevieve's career spans works in photography, video, kinetic sculpture, and performance, covering an array of deep and dangerous contradictions between ethics and sexuality, transness and gender, censorship and pornography, and pointing to the asymmetries between neoliberal capitalism and the limits of sexual self-determination. The late artist's archives touch on how the refusal of sexual consciousness leads to missed connections of difference and sameness, reducing images of female and sexed bodies to the delusional realm of the pornographic. Reclaiming the vocabulary of queer, loving, and sexual bodies to a nonreproductive, carnal erotic, DeGenevieve provides an escape route from heterosexual paradigms of marriage and family toward the excitement of her subjects outside the distorting pressures of bourgeois, heteronormative society. Her erotics motivate joy and pain, as the artist remains steadfast in her dedication to the liberation of her subjects, touching viewers to consider where the personal and political meet within their bodies.

Inhabiting the interstitial landscape between light installation, abstract painting, and immersive environment, Luftwerk shows viewers the degrees of luminosity and darkness held within our experience of humanity, journeying us into the future and the past. Honing in on Lindberg's inquiry of indigo, the collective's intervention raises unmediated feelings as high-mounted stage lights throw primary colors on two facing walls. Each wall bears a concentric, rectangular landscape-oriented painting—one moving from a light center to a dark outer edge, the other its exact inversion. Standing mid-trek, between landscapes, soaked in Luftwerk's multihued cosmos, we transgress a signifying limit between spatial polarities. Quieting the chaos of the world, activating the erotic faculty of color, the body, and landscape, viewers are no longer held up as fodder for social order.

Harnessing the manifold techniques and processes of performance and video, a détournement addresses issues of self-portraiture and outward projection, as Campos morphs their body through green-screen processes in a single-channel video, muse over a muse . Cannibalizing the fetishizing gaze of the viewer, Campos 'self-muses' as they become Celeste. Standing head-on in a confessional frame with no makeup nor costume, intercut with textural and fluid apparitions of their body in drag, the artist invites viewers into the psyche of the silhouette. Across the room, a small CRT TV screens a four-minute, first-person point-of-view video of the interior of a nightclub in my minds eye . A plaster bust adorned with a spiked and studded eye mask radiates three long, black, high ponytails. Green screen walls liquify societal signifiers imposed by sexist, racist, transphobic, and medicalizing narratives as infinite vulnerabilities open up within the performativity of drag.

Alberto Ortega Trejo: 'One of the qualities of nocturnal beings is that they speak words of truth' Trejo explored ideas of Indigenous survival against ecological and epistemic violence imposed on former third-world nations. For his first solo presentation at Prairie—which closed October 5—Trejo delved into the psyche of the feral inhabitants of darkness. A modernized mimicry of prehistoric cave drawings on fiber cement panels framed in fabricated steel-hinged wall panels, The Dream and the Intoxication (Pedo de Zorrillo) and The mirror that smokes (Caca de Cacomixtle) summon the nocturnal consciousness. Metonymic headlights shock and blind the dispossessed; postcolonial anxieties loom between cultures, disciplines, beliefs, human and nonhuman entities. Trejo spun the viewer through in-between states, journeying us through cosmological beliefs of the Otomí tribe and the expansion of the U.S. capitalist empire in his hometown in central Mexico. At the center of the cosmos, a scaled sculpture of oil pipelines that have exploded between the U.S. and Mexico sat aflame. Dividing signs based on the project of modernity over the grit of people, zones of abandonment, capitalist extractivism, and border violences echoed Indigenous voices. Mutating narratives through an intentional misread of mythology as geographic fact, Trejo presented viewers with neither interpretation nor complete truth on the political suffering of his people, leaving us in the uncanny space of bureaucracy. John Akomfrah, Four Nocturnes , 2019, three channel HD colour video installation, at Wrightwood 659 © 2024 Alphawood Exhibitions LLC, Chicago Credit: Michael Tropea 8. John Akomfrah: 'Four Nocturnes' Akomfrah's three-screen, large-scale video installation Four Nocturnes (2019) draws a view of the mutuality between ecological and human destruction. An accompanying installation of rural nostalgia, Toxic Cloud (2019), composed of plastic jugs used for transporting oil in Ghana, forms the entryway to a darkened viewing room. Seated in the solitude of a vast expanse of scorched desert, burning fields, and rubble, the work speaks of the cruelty of man-made developmental agendas. The forced displacement of eco-migrants in the first chapter is juxtaposed with the mass migration of animals in the third chapter, where herds of gazelles and elephants are seen crossing the wetness of marshlands. Archival images of colonial poaching practices, white hunters, and enslaved laborers appear and disappear across screens. A kind-eyed elephant separated from its herd searches for water, or meaning, or companionship, or all of it. Centuries of abuse and dispossession fold into a subtle score of incidental and created sounds, as Akomfrah whispers of eco-colonial violences that have systematically led to the misconception of man's power over nature. Tracing the former sovereignty of migration in animal life alongside routes of displaced African peoples, Akomfrah encircles us in the interdependencies of all of our lives. 'Four Nocturnes' implores us to consider our eco-political footprint, compelling us to move differently to break intergenerational cycles of human suffering based on extractivist capital and the lack of post-colonialist imagination.

(The show closed October 20.) Words cut from calendars, notes in personal notebooks and marginalia, and Latino Fan Club pornographic magazines are read as absurdist poetry. Coded in messages is the use of Brown bodies, 'bodies that support fantasies along the coast,' Saudi explains in an accompanying artist book, Othered Beaches . Situating queerness, foreignness, sexualized machismo, and class difference in the imaginary of paradise, Saudi interrupts the presence of minorities in high-end tourist destinations, establishing a dissonance between neocolonial economics and the policing of gendered (perceived) minority groups. Articulated as cut out party banners from archival editions of Latino Fan Club magazines, carved words read 'CONSUMING ISLANDS CARNIVOROUS WARMTH OF FLESH IN THE MAW SPEARS OF PALMS UNFURLED INSIDE EXTENDING OUTWARDS OF SUN KISSED SKIN LIGHTLY SALTED FROM SWEAT AM I A PART OF HIS SOIL PERVERTING FLOWERS.'

"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pressing for the release of hostages and the end of conflict in Gaza following Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's killing. Blinken's visit marked his 11th trip to the Middle East since the Gaza war began, prior to the impending U.S. election that could shift policy. Blinken aimed to manage the escalating conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where an Israeli airstrike killed 18 people near Beirut. Despite efforts, obstacles persist in achieving resolutions on both fronts. The U.S. State Department emphasized an opportunity for peace following Sinwar's death, yet Netanyahu's office offered no ceasefire assurance. Western nations see Sinwar's death as a potential breakthrough, giving Netanyahu's government political cover to claim objectives in Gaza. However, Israel insists on continuing its campaign until Hamas is dismantled. Meanwhile, humanitarian aid for Gaza remains a vital concern, with Blinken advocating for improved aid efforts amid ongoing tensions. (With inputs from agencies.)",

Compound architectures, like those employed by Mobileye, divide tasks into separate modules, resulting in an information bottleneck. Monolithic end-to-end systems like Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) suite face issues with explainability, transparency, and efficiency in adapting to new scenarios. Autobrains' Skills architecture addresses these issues by decomposing autonomous driving into a collection of smaller, context-specific AI models - referred to as ""Skills""-each trained and deployed independently. These Skills are activated dynamically based on the driving situation, optimizing performance and significantly reducing computational power demands. Key advantages of the Autobrains' Skills product line include: Optimized for Edge Cases: Each Skill is optimized to handle specific driving scenarios, leading to superior performance in edge cases. Scalability: The Skills architecture can expand from tens of skills for ADAS applications to hundreds of thousands for full autonomy. Adaptability: Skills are activated only when relevant, minimizing power consumption. Logarithmic Resource Growth: Unlike models that require exponentially more resources as they scale, the Skills architecture allows for more efficient, logarithmic resource expansion. Enhanced Safety: By focusing on specific edge cases, Skills provide precise, targeted responses, enhancing overall system safety. Autobrains is actively collaborating with major OEMs worldwide, testing and implementing the Skills product line to transform the future of autonomy. This cutting-edge AI architecture is poised to lower costs, improve safety, and drive the next wave of smarter, more efficient autonomous driving systems.

"""France has always been antisemitic,' former French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner told Paris Jewish station Radio J on Sunday in a conversation about Israel, the war in Gaza, and French antisemitism. 'Antisemitism is the belief of fools,' Kouchner, who served as foreign minister from 2007 to 2010 under President Nicolas Sarkozy, told the interviewer. 'When there's nothing to think about, one turns to antisemitism. When there's any kind of misfortune, one turns to antisemitism. It's a very profound sickness.' When asked whether he thought the antisemitism that sparked the Holocaust was happening again, Kouchner replied that 'it never really stopped.' Kouchner's paternal grandparents fled the Russian pogroms and moved to France, only later to be deported to, and murdered in, Auschwitz. 'France has always been antisemitic,' he continued, adding that it had nevertheless increased in the last year. This comes after the Jewish Community Protection Service told the Jerusalem Post in July that there had been a 1000% increase in recorded incidents of antisemitism in 2023 compared to the previous year, setting a new baseline norm for antisemitism in 2024. Part of the reason for this hatred of Jews, he told the interviewer, lies in lack of education; 'Many young French people don't even know what the Holocaust is.' Kouchner lamented a lack of knowledge of Jewish history: 'We talk about colonization, about hatred, about territorial expansion, about genocide. But we talk about genocide without knowing what it really means.' He did, however, add that, with the war, many might find it hard ""not to be antisemitic when you see the destruction caused by the Israeli army in Gaza.' When questioned whether he was saying it was normal to be antisemitic, he said it was 'not normal,' but a not surprising reaction, given the war, devastation, and destruction. Israel-Hamas War Speaking on the war in Gaza and in the wider region, Kouchner said that while he fully supported Israel's right to retaliate, and indeed exist, he felt the response to the October 7 massacre was disproportionate. 'It's a disproportionate war. Israel's military response after October 7 was legitimate and necessary—we expected it. But to continue like this and only have a military solution is a mistake."" Nevertheless, he stated, 'It was impossible not to react to those who killed 1,200 people and kidnapped 300 people.' While, Kouchner said, Israel's reaction was 'extremely brutal,' he continued that 'it is the way it is; Israel had to react.' 'Israel wants to live, I want Israel to live,' he added. Kouchner stressed that his issue was not with Israel, rather with war. As a doctor and a politician, he added that he had spent his life 'trying to stop wars, with varying success, and also helping to treat the wounded.' Arms embargo Despite his aversion to war, Kouchner strongly criticized French President Emmanuel Macron's call to withhold arms from Israel. Macron said earlier this month that shipments of arms used in the conflict in Gaza should be stopped as part of a broader effort to find a political solution. 'It saddened me to hear the President of France - and therefore France - speak like that,' he said. 'He is not an ignorant man; he knows the history of the Jews.' He added that Macron had shown a 'level of aggression towards Israel' that he felt was not justified. 'I'm not saying it's hatred, but his level of condemnation of Israel is disproportionate to what happened,' he continued. 'It was a grave error.'",

"SANAA, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's Houthi group said in a statement on Tuesday that it had launched a ""hypersonic ballistic missile"" towards Israel, and the attack was ""successful."" ""We carried out a qualitative military operation targeting an Israeli military base east of the Jaffa area with a hypersonic ballistic missile, Palestine-2,"" Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said via the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV. ""The missile succeeded in reaching the target, bypassing the American and Israeli interception systems,"" he said, vowing for continued military operations against Israel ""until the Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon stops."" So far, the Israeli side has not commented on the Houthis claim. Since November last year, the Houthi group has been conducting missile and drone attacks on what it said were ""Israeli-linked"" ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, as well as targets in Israel, to show solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza. The Houthis have escalated attacks since the end of September after Israel killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on a building in the southern suburb of Beirut. ■",
"The Civil Defense in Gaza announced on Thursday that at least 17 people were killed and dozens were injured in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip, while the Israeli army claimed that it targeted Hamas militants. Civil Defense spokesman Mahmoud Basal said, ""The Israeli occupation targeted the Martyrs School in the Nuseirat area, and the initial toll is 17 martyrs and dozens of wounded, some of whom are in critical condition."" Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat confirmed the number of martyrs as a result of the occupation's bombing. For its part, the Israeli army claimed that it targeted Hamas militants in the raid on the school. ""The Israeli Air Force carried out a strike on Hamas 'terrorists' who were operating inside a command and control centre in the Nuseirat area located inside the school,"" he added in a statement. He continued, ""The command and control center. ""Used to plan and carry out attacks against IDF forces and the State of Israel."" Umm Mohammed, who survived the raid, said she was sitting in one of the rows before stones and glass started falling on her head. She added, ""I hugged my little girl, I didn't see anything because of the density of the smoke and I ran screaming for my sister and found her downstairs alive."" She added that she saw ""children, body parts, smoke and fire."" Yahya Abu Kamil, who was displaced from Gaza City to the Nuseirat camp, said, 'This is a shelter center. We have been living here for about a year and there are no armed men there... Here are civilians displaced from Gaza.' In a statement, Hamas said the Israeli raid on the school represented ""the Zionist enemy's persistence in committing horrific massacres against defenceless civilians in shelters and displacement centres."" The government media office stated that ""the occupation army knew that the school contained thousands of displaced people, and that the majority of them were children and women who had been displaced from their homes and whose civilian residential neighborhoods had been bombed."" In recent months, Israeli forces have targeted several schools in the Gaza Strip after they became displacement centers, but the army always claims that it is targeting Hamas fighters.",
"Saudi Gazette report KAZAN — On behalf of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman, Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Faisal bin Farhan led the Saudi delegation attending the 2024 BRICS Plus Summit in the Russian city of Kazan. Addressing the summit, Prince Faisal expressed the Kingdom's concern over the escalation of global tensions especially in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. ""At a time when we most need to confront global challenges, we are witnessing an escalation of tensions and growing polarization and axes, which weakens the flexibility and effectiveness of multilateral forums. Saudi Arabia supports strengthening international institutions to ensure that the needs of all countries are met,"" he said. Prince Faisal emphasized that the continuation of the Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon poses a serious threat to regional and international security. He warned that the continuation of this conflict will lead to a worsening of the situation in the region. The foreign minister stressed the need for an immediate ceasefire, as well as to ensure the provision of humanitarian assistance without hindrance, the release of hostages, and a serious commitment to achieving lasting peace. Prince Faisal drew attention to the Kingdom's efforts to achieve peace in the region, including the Kingdom's launch last month of the ""International Alliance for the Implementation of the Two-State Solution"" initiative in cooperation with its international partners. ""Granting the Palestinians the right to self-determination is the only way to achieve sustainable peace,"" he said while appreciating the solidarity of the BRICS countries with the Palestinian cause, and their support for a solution based on the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. The foreign minister conveyed the greetings of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman and Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the leaders of the BRICS countries, expressing his appreciation for the warm welcome and generous hospitality accorded to the Saudi delegation. Prince Faisal drew attention to the growing relations between the Kingdom and the BRICS countries. ""The volume of bilateral trade with the group's countries exceeded $196 billion in 2023, representing 37 percent of the Kingdom's total foreign trade. ""The summit is an opportunity to enhance cooperation with the group's countries to face global challenges and support sustainable development,"" he said. Prince Faisal also confirmed that the Kingdom will continue to strengthen its partnerships with the BRICS group and expand the horizons of cooperation in all fields, in an effort to achieve development and prosperity at the international level.",

"AN Israeli strike on a school where displaced people were sheltering in the central Gaza Strip killed at least 17 people on Thursday, Palestinian medical officials said. They said the victims were nearly all women and children. The Israeli military said it targeted Hamas militants in a command and control centre inside the school, without providing evidence. Another 42 people were wounded in the strike in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. READ MORE: Al Jazeera rejects 'unfounded' Israeli claims about Gaza journalists Among the dead were 13 children under the age of 18 and three women, according to the hospital's records. Israel has carried out several strikes on schools-turned-shelters in recent months, saying it precisely targets Hamas militants hiding out among civilians. The strikes often kill women and children. Health workers in besieged northern Gaza meanwhile warned of a catastrophic situation there, where Israel has been waging an air and ground offensive for more than two weeks. READ MORE: 'Team Scotland': Argyll volunteers deliver aid to Gaza refugees The director of a hospital said it is running short on supplies and first responders said they can no longer rescue people. In a separate development, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced another 135 million dollars (£104 million) in aid to the Palestinians. He spoke in Qatar on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the war in Gaza. The US has pressed Israel to allow more aid into the war-ravaged Palestinian territory. The US hopes to renew the negotiations after Israeli forces killed top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar (below) in Gaza last week, but neither side has shown any sign of moderating its demands. Around 100 Israeli hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's invasion has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The war has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people are crammed into tent camps along the coast after entire neighbourhoods in many areas were pounded to rubble. Months of ceasefire negotiations brokered by the US, Egypt and Qatar sputtered to a halt over the summer. The war has meanwhile expanded to Lebanon, where Israel launched a ground invasion more than three weeks ago after trading fire with the Hezbollah militant group for much of the past year.",
"New Israeli attacks increase risk of famine in Gaza Scenes from a bakery in southern Gaza illustrate a recent IPC report that finds 91% of the population of the besieged Strip will soon face 'acute levels of hunger'. The Israeli blockade of the Rafah Crossing has meant flour is extremely scarce and the cost of bread has skyrocketed, for those that can still afford it. The most recent IPC update on Gaza's food security, published 17 October 2024, said that around 350,000 Palestinians are due to enter 'phase 5' of the food insecurity scale, 'catastrophic hunger', which is where people face 'an extreme lack of food and a high risk of death and malnutrition'.",
"A new campaign ad for Donald Trump pushes back against Kamala Harris' claim that the former president is a 'fascist' by featuring a Holocaust survivor who says Harris is disgracing his murdered family members with the allegation. 'Adolf Hitler invaded Poland when I was 9 years old. He murdered my parents and most of my family,' says 94-year-old Jerry Wartski, an Auschwitz survivor and retired New York City real estate investor in the ad released Friday. 'I know more about Hitler than Kamala will ever know in a thousand lifetimes. For her to accuse President Trump of being like Hitler is the worst thing I've ever heard in my 75 years living in the United States,' Wartski continues. 'I know President Trump, and he would never say this. And Kamala Harris knows it. She owes my parents and everybody else who was murdered by Hitler an apology for repeating this lie.' The ad follows a mounting discourse about the use of the term 'fascist' in the presidential race. A growing number of experts on fascism, as well as officials who served under him during his four years as president, have said the label befits Trump, who openly admires dictators and has discussed using the power of the presidency to retaliate against his opponents. The discourse accelerated last week after The Atlantic reported that Trump had reportedly expressed admiration for Hitler's generals. Labeling Trump as a facist Harris applied the label to Trump herself for the first time during a CNN town hall meeting Wednesday night. Asked whether she believed Trump was a fascist, she answered, 'Yes, I do.' She also said Americans believe in democracy and 'not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.' The ad is meant to rebut the criticism at a pivotal time. An ABC poll released Friday found that half of registered voters consider Trump a fascist, suggesting that the concern could play a meaningful role in the Nov. 5 election. The poll, conducted before the most recent headlines, found that about 8% of voters planned to vote for Trump despite believing that he was a fascist. Contrary to Wartski's suggestion in the video, Trump has referred to Harris as a fascist multiple times in the past. The poll also found that one in five voters would apply the label to Harris. Wartski's deployment in the campaign ad reflects the particular resonance of fascism for Jewish voters given fascism's strong historical association with Hitler and the Nazis, and the degree to which Jewish ideas and concerns are playing a central role in the presidential race in its final days. Both campaigns are fighting for Jewish voters who make up significant constituencies in multiple swing states. Wartski, a retired New York City real estate entrepreneur, is a registered Republican who has donated extensively to national Republicans, including Trump, and to local Democratic politicians, according to campaign finance records. Earlier this month, he accompanied Trump on a visit to the Rebbe's Ohel, the Queens gravesite of the last Chabad-Lubavitch rabbi. In the ad, Wartski, rolling up his sleeve to show a number tattooed on his arm, is asked by a voice off-screen, 'Why should the Jewish people support President Trump?' He answers: 'Because he's a mensch. I believe that President Trump is definitely going to be good for Israel, because in everything he's done up to now was in favor. He's never double-crossed anyone, and he never showed any weakness. … He has always stood with the Jewish people and the state of Israel.' (The ad is not the first to employ the word 'mensch,' Yiddish for a decent and upstanding person, in a presidential campaign, though it is the first to come from a candidate's campaign. In 2020, the Jewish Democratic Council of America promoted Joe Biden as a 'mensch in the White House.') Different purpose for media appearances Until recently, Wartski — the honorary president of the Israel Heritage Foundation advocacy group, which last year honored Trump by giving him a silver Torah crown — had appeared in the media in conjunction with his real estate dealings. Much of that coverage was critical: A 1991 Jerusalem Report story revealed that New York City Fire Department investigators had pegged Wartski in a 1983 report at the center of a group of landlords whose properties caught fire at a rate more than twice the norm, at a time when many were seeking to push out single-room occupancy tenants to convert their units to more profitable ones. Meanwhile, the Village Voice placed Wartski and his two sons on a list of the city's 'most heartless' SRO landlords in 1994, according to a 2017 New York Post report. Wartski also drew attention more recently as the landlord of a Manhattan table tennis club whose operator, Wang Chen, credits him with facilitating her success in the sport. Wartski gave his first-ever interview about his Holocaust experience in 2020 to Fox News, when he and his family traveled to Auschwitz to mark the 75th anniversary of its liberation. He described narrowly evading death for two years in two ghettos — first in his hometown of Osjakow, Poland, and then in the bigger city of Lodz — before his family was sent to Auschwitz. His mother, Esther, was murdered there, while his father, Jacob, died of starvation after a forced march just before Allied troops arrived. Wartski and his brother survived and spent years in Displaced Persons camps — where he said he first encountered ping-pong — before being allowed into the United States in 1949. He said he had not told his children about his experience but had reconsidered as he reached 90. 'Now I see that there are not a lot of people left who can tell the story,' Wartski said at the time. 'The stories that you hear are just unreal and unbelievable, and you have to talk.'",
"DUBAI/JERUSALEM/CAIRO (Oct 26): Iran on Saturday played down Israel's overnight air attack against Iranian military targets, saying it caused only limited damage, as US President Joe Biden called for a halt to escalation that has raised fears of an all-out conflagration in the Middle East. Scores of Israeli jets completed three waves of strikes before dawn against missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran, Israel's military said. It was retaliation for Iran's Oct 1 attack on Israel with about 200 ballistic missiles, and Israel warned its heavily armed arch-foe not to hit back after the latest strike. Iran condemned the Israeli raid and its foreign ministry said Iran was ""entitled and obligated"" to defend itself. But it added that it ""recognises its responsibilities towards regional peace and security,"" a more conciliatory statement than after previous bouts of escalation. Iran's military said the Israeli warplanes used ""very light warheads"" to target border radar systems in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and around Tehran. ""Enemy planes were prevented from entering the country's airspace ... and the attack caused limited damage,"" Iran's military joint staff said in a statement. David Albright, a former United Nations (UN) nuclear weapons inspector, said low resolution commercial satellite imagery appeared to show that one Israeli strike hit the sprawling Parchin military complex near Tehran, damaging three buildings, including two where solid fuel was mixed for ballistic missile engines. Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at CNA, a Washington think tank, said Israel also hit Khojir, a sprawling missile production site near Tehran. Tensions between Iran and Israel have grown rapidly since the Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel by Iran-backed Hamas, raising fears of a wider regional conflict that could drag in global powers and imperil world energy supplies. Worsening conflict in Lebanon, where Israel is waging an intense campaign against Iran's main regional ally Hezbollah to stop it firing rockets into northern Israel, has raised the temperature still further. The United States, which had pressed Israel to avoid targeting sensitive Iranian energy and nuclear sites, joined other countries in calling for a halt to the cycle of confrontation between Israel and Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that Israel had chosen the targets in Iran based on its national interests, not according to what was dictated by the United States. Biden said the strikes appeared to have only hit military targets and added that he hoped they were ""the end"". Vice President Kamala Harris, who hopes to succeed Biden by winning the Nov 5 US presidential election, said it was ""the strong perspective of the United States that there must be de-escalation"". Two regional officials briefed by Iran told Reuters that several high-level meetings were held in Tehran to determine the scope of Iran's response. One official said the damage was ""very minimal"" but added that several Revolutionary Guards bases in and around Tehran were also hit. Iranian news sites aired footage of passengers at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport, seemingly meant to show there was little impact. Israel's military, signalling it did not expect an immediate Iranian response, said there was no change to public safety restrictions across the country. Beni Sabti, an Iran expert at Tel Aviv's Institute for National Security Studies, said the Israeli strike appeared designed to give Tehran an opportunity to avoid further escalation. ""We see that Israel wants to close this event, to pass this message to Iran that it is closed and we don't want to escalate it,"" he said. Videos carried by Iranian media showed air defences continuously firing at apparently incoming projectiles in central Tehran, without saying which sites were coming under attack. Israel's military said its jets had struck missile manufacturing facilities and surface-to-air missile arrays, and safely returned home. ""If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond,"" the military said. US Defense Secretary LLoyd Austin in a statement said Iran ""should not make the mistake of responding to Israel's strikes."" Austin said he also stressed in a call with his Israeli counterpart diplomatic opportunities to lower tensions in the region, including in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel notified the US before striking, but Washington was not involved in the operation, a US official told Reuters. Targets did not include energy infrastructure or Iran's nuclear facilities, a US official said. In the days after Iran's strikes on Israel this month, Biden had warned that Washington, Israel's main backer and supplier of arms, would not support a retaliatory strike on Tehran's nuclear sites and had said Israel should consider alternatives to attacking Iran's oil fields. Arab states situated between Israel and Iran have been particularly worried that use of their airspace could prompt retaliation against them. Jordanian television quoted a source in the country's armed forces as saying no military planes had been allowed through its airspace. A Saudi official also said that Saudi airspace had not been used for the strike. A regional intelligence source said Israeli jets had flown across southern Syria, emitting sonic booms near the Jordanian border, and then across Iraq. Saudi Arabia, which has mended fences with Iran after years of regional rivalry, and had been edging towards better ties with Israel before the war in Gaza, condemned the attack as a violation of Iranian sovereignty and international law. Israel's military eased some safety restrictions for residents in areas of northern Israel late on Saturday, a possible indication that it does not expect any immediate large-scale attack from Iran or its proxies in the region. The decision followed a ""situational assessment"", it said in a statement. Still, Lebanon's Hezbollah warned residents of more than two dozen towns in northern Israel to evacuate immediately, saying they had become legitimate targets because it said Israeli troops were stationed there. Israel meanwhile said it had struck Hezbollah facilities in Beirut's southern Dahiyeh suburb, including a weapons-making site and an intelligence headquarters. The conflict in Lebanon, which has greatly intensified in recent weeks, has also led to strikes on sites linked to Iran and Hezbollah in Syria. Israel launched airstrikes against some military sites in central and southern Syria early on Saturday, Syrian state news agency SANA reported. Israel has not confirmed striking Syria. Efforts to secure a ceasefire and hostage-release deal in Gaza, which could help cool the wider conflict, are expected to resume in Doha when negotiators fly there on Sunday.",
"SINGAPORE/LONDON Oil prices are expected to fall when trading resumes on Monday, as Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran over the weekend bypassed Tehran's oil and nuclear infrastructure and did not disrupt energy supplies, analysts said. Brent and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 4% last week in volatile trade, as markets priced in uncertainty around the extent of Israel's response to the Iranian missile attack on Oct 1, as well as the US election next month. Scores of Israeli jets completed three waves of strikes before dawn on Saturday against missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran, in the latest exchange in the escalating conflict between the Middle East rivals. ""The market can breathe a big sigh of relief; the known unknown that was Israel's eventual response to Iran has been resolved,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, group head of research at Onyx said on LinkedIn. ""Israel attacked after the departure of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and the US administration could not have hoped for a better outcome with US elections less than two weeks away."" Iran on Saturday played down Israel's overnight air attack against Iranian military targets, saying it caused only limited damage. ""Israel's not attacking oil infrastructure, and reports that Iran won't respond to the strike remove an element of uncertainty,"" Tony Sycamore, an IG market analyst in Sydney, said. ""It's very likely we see a 'buy the rumour, sell the fact' type [of] reaction when the crude oil futures markets reopen tomorrow,"" he said, adding that WTI may return to US$70 a barrel level. Tchilinguirian expects geopolitical risk premium that had been built into oil prices to deflate rapidly, with Brent heading back towards US$74 to US$75 a barrel. UBS commodity analyst Giovanni Staunovo also expects oil prices to be depressed on Monday, as Israel's response to Iran's attack appeared to have been restrained. ""But I would expect such downside reaction to be only temporary, as I believe the market didn't price a large risk premium,"" he added.",

Israel's military eased some safety restrictions for residents in areas of northern Israel late on Saturday, a possible indication that it does not expect any immediate large-scale attack from Iran or its proxies in the region. The decision followed a ""situational assessment"", it said in a statement. Still, Lebanon's Hezbollah warned residents of more than two dozen towns in northern Israel to evacuate immediately, saying they had become legitimate targets because it said Israeli troops were stationed there. Israel meanwhile said it had struck Hezbollah facilities in Beirut's southern Dahiyeh suburb including a weapons-making site and an intelligence headquarters. The conflict in Lebanon, which has greatly intensified in recent weeks, has also led to strikes on sites linked to Iran and Hezbollah in Syria. Israel launched airstrikes against some military sites in central and southern Syria early on Saturday, Syrian state news agency SANA reported. Israel has not confirmed striking Syria. Efforts to secure a ceasefire and hostage-release deal in Gaza, which could help cool the wider conflict, are expected to resume in Doha when negotiators fly there on Sunday (Oct 27).",

"Jerusalem: Israel's airstrikes 'hit hard' Iran's defences and missile production, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the damage from Saturday's attack should not be exaggerated. 'The air force attacked throughout Iran. We hit hard Iran's defence capabilities and its ability to produce missiles that are aimed at us,' Netanyahu said in a speech, calling the attack 'precise and powerful' and saying it met all its objectives. With warfare raging in Gaza and Lebanon, direct confrontation between Israel and Iran risks spiralling into a regional conflagration. But a day after the airstrikes, there was no sign they would spark another round of escalation.

Credit: AP Separately, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Iran was no longer able to use its allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon against Israel. The two groups 'are no longer an effective tool' of Tehran, he said in a speech. Gallant added that Hamas was no longer functioning as a military network in Gaza and that Hezbollah's senior command and most of its missile capabilities had been eliminated. Hamas has repeatedly said it is still able to function militarily, and Israel has recently conducted major new operations in devastated north Gaza against what it calls regrouping Hamas militants. Hezbollah has said its command structure remains intact and that it retains significant missile capabilities. Loading On Sunday, the Israeli military urged residents of 14 villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate immediately and move north of the Awali river. An Israeli strike on Sidon, a city in coastal south Lebanon, killed at least eight people and wounded 25 on Sunday, the country's health ministry said. Elsewhere in the south, a strike on Zawtar al-Sharkiya killed three people and a Saturday bombing of Marjayoun killed five, it said. Israel said four of its soldiers were killed in south Lebanon fighting. Hezbollah also said it had fired a large missile salvo at the Zevulon military industries facility north of Haifa in northern Israel. Hezbollah rockets hit a house and cars and rescue crews responded to put out the fire. One woman was seriously injured, according to Israel's ambulance service.

"Iran Press/ Asia: On Saturday early morning, October 26, the Israeli regime tried to hit some targets within the Iranian national territories as several sounds resembling explosions were heard, particularly in western Tehran, the capital, and Khuzestan and Ilam Provinces in Western Iran. The Israeli missiles were intercepted and caused little damage. Raja Nassir Abbas Jafari said in a message that the Israeli regime's attack on Iran, which was carried out with the US political and logistical support, proved that it was not just a matter of the Israeli war on Gaza but a war on the whole Islamic world. Jafari noted that the Israeli regime and its supporters seek to protect the survival of the Zionist entity from the Resistance Front and the Islamic Republic in the region, so they are spreading war through the continuation of the crimes the regime is perpetrating. He stressed: ""The issue that is more worrying and the international community should not ignore is the logistical and intelligence support provided by the US to the Zionist regime to attack Iran, which shows the human-advocate country's desire to continue violence and war."" The Pakistani MP called on the Islamic country to provide the resistance front with military and financial support. It is more than one year, since October 7, 2023, that the Israeli regime, backed by the US, has launched an all-out war in the region and is massacring the people of Gaza, West Bank, and Lebanon while assaulting other countries like Iran and Syria. The regime's attack on Gaza and Lebanon since the day has left more than 45,000 Palestinians and Lebanese martyred and more than 100,000 others wounded. 215 Read more: Iran Air Defense Forces: Israel Attacks Caused Limited Damage",
"MICHIGAN: A group of prominent Muslim leaders joined Donald Trump on stage at a rally in the US state of Michigan to announce their support for the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 presidential election. The leaders cited the former president's commitment to ending conflicts. 'We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace, not war,' Imam Belal Alzuhairi told the rally in the Detroit suburb of Novi. 'We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end the war in the Middle East and Ukraine. The bloodshed has to stop all over the world. And I think this man can make that happen.' Trump, in turn, emphasized that Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan and across the country want a 'stop to the endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East.' 'That's all they want,' he said. He highlighted Vice President Kamala Harris' association with former Republican Rep. from the state of Wyoming, Liz Cheney, known for her father's role in promoting the US invasion of Iraq in 2001 and the ensuing wars. Dick and Liz Cheney have endorsed Harris for president. On Israel's offensive in Gaza since October 7, 2023, Trump previously stated that he would allow Israel to 'finish the problem' in its fight against Hamas, signaling support for Israel's actions in Gaza. Traditionally supportive of Democrats, Michigan's Muslim community has increasingly turned against the Biden administration because of its unconditional backing of Israel, despite a rising civilian death toll in Gaza. In February, more than 100,000 Democratic voters chose 'uncommitted' in the state's presidential primary election after the Uncommitted campaign urged voters to protest President Joe Biden's Gaza policy as he sought reelection. The Democratic Party further strained relations when it declined the Uncommitted movement's request to include a Palestinian American speaker at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago in August. Adding to the tension, former Michigan congressional candidate, Dr. Ahmed Ghanim, reported being removed Monday without explanation from an invitation-only Harris event in suburban Detroit. In response, the Harris campaign expressed regret. 'Our campaign regrets this action and its impact on Dr Ghanim and the community, and he is welcome at future events,' it said. About 300,000 individuals of Middle Eastern and North African descent reside in Michigan, accounting for 3.1% of the state's population. Biden defeated Trump in Michigan in the 2020 presidential race, by a margin of just over 150,000 votes, a significant contrast to 2016, when Trump won by less than 11,000 votes against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.",

"THE Scottish Greens will push for the SNP Government to end funding for firms arming Israel in Budget negotiations. It comes as John Swinney and his government need to find support from at least one of the opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament if the Budget, which will be unveiled by Finance Secretary Shona Robison on December 4, is to pass. Scottish Greens MSP Ross Greer told The National that it's an issue the party have pushed for a long time and it will 'absolutely be put forward in negotiations'. He stressed, however, that the government could also do it 'at any time'. Despite repeatedly speaking out in favour of an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the Scottish Government has continued to hand public money to arms companies supplying Israel and profiting from the destruction. Earlier this year, it was reported Raytheon, BAE Systems, and Leonardo had all received taxpayer-funded grants from Scottish Enterprise since Israel began its assault on Palestine after the Hamas attacks on October 7. BAE was paid its grant – worth £360,000 – on April 4, just a day after then-first minister Humza Yousaf wrote to the UK Government calling for arms sales to be stopped. The company helps make the F-35 fighter jet which Israel has used to bomb Gaza. 'We've been calling on the SNP to stop the enterprise grants for months now in the context of the ongoing genocide,' Greer said at the Scottish Greens conference in Greenock. 'They could decide tomorrow to stop issuing grants, and not just the companies involved in supplying arms and military equipment. They could and they should ban any company on the UN list of those complicit in illegal settlements from being able to receive a grant.' The Green MSP (above) added: 'We recognise that procurement law around contracts is quite challenging, and we'd really be pushing at the limits of devolution there. Though the Greens want to try.' 'These settlements are unquestionably a fundamental and grave breach of Palestinian human rights, and we've seen over recent months that, as well as the ongoing genocide in Gaza, there are thousands of Palestinians being murdered in the West Bank by illegal Israeli settlers – who we would refer to as terrorists – as well as by Israeli soldiers.' Greer went on: 'So we would actually want to go further than just the arms companies. 'We think it's obvious that the Scottish government shouldn't be funding arms companies. 'That's always been a point of difference between us and the SNP. But we want to go further and actually ban any company who is complicit in the illegal occupation, not just in the military aspect of it.' 'We'll put it forward as part of budget discussions, but we've always been very clear with the SNP – it's a decision that the government can take any given day.'",
"There are a host of issues at play in this presidential election. To many voters, there are more important issues than antisemitism and Israel. But to those who fear the unprecedented rise of Jew-hatred in this country and the existential risks facing the State of Israel, these issues loom large like never before. Jews living in America whose attire and religious practices identify them as Jews, along with Jews living in Israel, are on the front lines of the respective waves of hatred and violence domestically and inside the Jewish state. Overwhelmingly, and for very good reasons, they prefer president Donald Trump to Vice President Kamala Harris. Here are the main reasons why. 1. Antisemitism at home Fighting antisemitism requires an expansion of law enforcement and an aggressive campaign to deport anti-American and anti-Israel foreign agitators who have entered our country on false pretenses and invaded college campuses. America's most elite universities have become ground zero for the advancement of an antisemitic, Marxist agenda. President Trump wants these agitators out of our country and he will send them home. And those breaking the law will go to jail. Importantly, in December 2019, long before antisemitism exploded on college campuses, President Trump signed an executive order extending the reach of Title VI to antisemitic conduct. That means that universities receiving Federal funding (almost all do) will lose that assistance if they fail to protect their Jewish students from hatred and violence. Vice President Harris has shown no interest in empowering law enforcement, holding back funding to offending universities or otherwise stopping the spread of antisemitism. In her meetings with far-left anti-Israel student groups, she has validated many of their false charges. The rise of domestic antisemitism has, of course, occurred on her watch. 2. The Hamas War Since the brutal assault by Hamas on October 7, 2023, President Trump has been clear-eyed and unambiguous: Israel must be empowered to win the war as quickly and decisively as possible. Had Trump been in office, I believe that Israel's impending victory would have occurred much sooner with a far better outcome for the hostages that remain in captivity by Hamas. Harris has just been terrible. While she attempts to skate by with the platitude that 'Israel has the right to defend itself' (what country doesn't have that right?), she and her administration have handcuffed Israel's operations and continue to withhold essential military assistance. Weeks went by as Harris and her team implored Israel not to enter Rafah. Fortunately, Netanyahu did not listen to her – Israel's invasion of Rafah led to the discovery of massive smuggling tunnels on the Egyptian border and resulted in the killing of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas. The recovery of some of Sinwar's writings now establishes conclusively that the criticism of Israel by Biden and Harris influenced Sinwar to resist a deal for the return of the hostages. 3. Record on Israel As president, Trump, simply put, was the best friend Israel ever had in the Oval Office. From moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and ensuring no daylight between the two allies, Trump has carved out for himself an exalted place in Israel's history. Harris, in contrast, boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's recent speech to a Joint Session of Congress, has never visited Israel as vice-president and is a frequent critic of the Jewish state. 4. US relationship with Iran When Trump left office, Iran was on the verge of bankruptcy and its chief architect of terror, Qasem Soleimani had been eliminated. Under Harris's administration, key sanctions have been lifted against Iran, which has more than doubled its GDP. These extra billions of dollars have funded terror operations in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Gaza. All because of her failed policies. 5. Abraham Accords The Trump administration brokered peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan, and Kosovo, referred to as the 'Abraham Accords.' As Biden and Harris ascended to power, the opportunities to expand the Abraham Accords seemed limitless. But instead of embracing the pro-Israel Trump policies that drove these agreements, Biden and Harris turned away from Israel and towards Iran. Their betrayal of Israel thrust the region into violence and upheaval and caused the Abraham Accords to stagnate. By every metric, Trump is better than Harris on antisemitism and Israel. But the point should be made with even greater force. On these issues, Trump was the best president in history while Harris, if elected, undoubtedly would be the worst. The difference is that stark.",
"The presidential office said it would monitor the situation in the Middle East ""around the clock"" and take all necessary steps to protect Korean nationals and companies in a meeting Sunday afternoon regarding the country's security and economic situation amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. On Saturday, Israel launched a series of airstrikes on Iran in retaliation against Tehran's ballistic missile barrage earlier in the month. Sung Tae-yoon, director of national policy at the presidential office, and Kim Tae-hyo, principal deputy national security adviser, chaired the emergency meeting at the presidential office in Yongsan District, central Seoul, during which attendees evaluated the situation in the Middle East following the attack and the safety of overseas Korean nationals, companies and diplomatic missions. The meeting addressed the protection of nationals and evacuation measures in preparation for the possibility of a worsening situation, the presidential office added in a statement. The presidential office determined that although the impact of geopolitical instability in the Middle East on Korea's economy is expected to be limited for now, it plans to continue to ""maintain a 24-hour monitoring system to prepare for the possibility of sudden changes in the situation in the Middle East region and immediately implement step-by-step measures, according to the response manual, if necessary."" The office added that though Israel's attack on Iran, which took place over the weekend, has not yet had impacted the domestic financial market, it will closely monitor any repercussions as the situation progresses. The office noted that the country's current crude oil stockpile is sufficient for more than 200 days and confirmed that there are currently no issues with the supply, demand and transportation of crude oil and gas. Seoul additionally resolved to continue to monitor the conflict's damages and ripple effects on not only domestic companies, but also Korean companies operating in the Middle East. The presidential office said it would ""cooperate closely with the international community to quickly restore stability in the Middle East and to preemptively take necessary measures,"" according to future developments. President Yoon Suk Yeol likewise stressed that the safety of Korean nationals is the government's ""top priority"" and ordered ""all necessary measures to be taken in preparation for a worsening situation,"" the presidential office said Saturday. Earlier Saturday, Yoon received a briefing on Israel's attack on Iran from the presidential National Security Office (NSO) after a meeting presided over by Yin Sung-hwan, second deputy director of the NSO, regarding safety measures for Koreans living in the region. The Korean government said it would operate a round-the-clock task force across government agencies to monitor tensions in the Middle East and support related measures. Seoul's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lee Jae-woong likewise expressed 'deep concern' over Israel's recent attack on Iran on Sunday, calling involved parties to break away from the ""cycle of attack and retaliation.' Earlier this month, the Korean government airlifted 96 Koreans out of Lebanon on a KC-330 military transport plane. The first evacuation operation came in the wake of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. There are around 110 nationals in Iran and 480 in Israel as of early October, the Korean Foreign Ministry said.",
"Screaming relatives of Hamas attack victims interrupted a speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday during October 7 commemorations. Netanyahu stood motionless at a lectern during the ceremony in Jerusalem as audience members in the crowd shouted, interrupting him for more than a minute, according to a live broadcast of the speech. One of the protesters repeatedly shouted, ""My father was killed"". Public and diplomatic pressure has been on Netanyahu's administration to do more to strike a deal for securing the release of captives still held in Gaza. Israeli spy chief David Barnea is scheduled to head to Doha on Sunday for talks aimed at restarting negotiations towards reaching a Gaza hostage release deal. Families of the remaining hostages along with several Western leaders have called on the Israeli government to broker an agreement after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar earlier this month. Israeli and US officials as well as some analysts said Sinwar had been a key obstacle to a deal allowing for the release of 97 hostages still held by militants in Gaza, 34 of whom the Israeli military says are dead. Critics in Israel have also accused Netanyahu of obstructing mediation for a truce and hostage-release deal. Earlier Sunday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said military action by itself will not achieve the country's war aims, which include bringing home the hostages. ""Not all objectives can be achieved through military operations alone... To realise our moral duty to bring our hostages home, we will have to make painful concessions,"" Gallant said in a separate speech marking the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the Hamas attack, which on October 7 last triggered the ongoing war in the Palestinian territory.",
"A report by the Homeward Forum, an organization of eleven of the southern communities hardest hit in the October 7 attack, found that residents are still severely impacted by the fallout of the attack. Some 29% reported that someone in their immediate family was injured, taken hostage, or killed on October 7. Respondents said that 90% of the respondents were harmed in health, and 97% were harmed in mental resilience. Thirty percent of the residents lost their source of income, 75% reported that their financial situation was harmed, and 77% of respondents said they are helped by the state with finding and funding housing. While 80% said that they are interested in living in the Gaza border region again, more than 70% said that they were not sure about this and debated whether returning was the right thing. Residents were not satisfied with how Israel's government handled the situation and cared for them, with 52% expressing that they were not satisfied. However, trust in local leadership was high, with 95% expressing that they trust the leadership of their towns. Eighty-six percent of the residents said that the community is an anchor for them, but 83% reported that their social situation has deteriorated since October 7. Urgent needs within Gaza border communities The report highlighted a number of urgent needs, including immediate and ongoing mental health support for residents and their families; economic aid to cover basic necessities and for financial rehabilitation; plans to increase security and the sense of security; temporary housing; and job placement and employment support. ""We expect of the government and Knesset that they will immediately advance solutions for the destroyed houses, bring the [revival] law for Knesset approval, and promote a plan for appropriate compensation to those harmed by the October 7 attacks,"" said forum chairman Ziv Mazliach. ""We demand certainty in budgets to rebuild and plan for the future,"" the forum said in the report, which also called for solutions, and the formation of a ministerial committee to coordinate efforts for the Gaza border region. ""We emphasize again - there will not be a revival without the return of our brothers and sisters held hostage."" ""As we mark the first year since October 7, it is important to us to look the complex reality, the hostages who are not with us, the brokenhearted communities straight in the eye,"" said Vered Libstein, a resident of Kfar Aza, whose husband, son, mother and nephew were killed in the attack. ""Along with this we must create a horizon and hope for another, better reality of revival of the Gaza border area,"" she added. The forum said the poll was conducted among 540 residents of the forum's towns, which represents a representative sample of the 6,000 people who live in these towns.",

Sun Aspects Sun trine Ascendant orb -0°22' Sun trine Moon orb +4°45' Sun conjunction Midheaven orb +8°19' Sun square Saturn orb +8°05' Sun 10°48' Pisces The Sun represents vitality, individuality, will-power and creative energy and honours. For a woman, it also represents her father, and later her husband. The Sun is one of the most important symbols in the birth chart, as much as the Ascendant, then the Moon (a bit less for a man), the ruler of the Ascendant and the fast-moving planets. It's element is fire; it is hot and dry, it governs Leo, is in exaltation in Aries and is in analogy with the heart. It represents the boss, authority, beside the father and the husband ; the age of the Sun goes from 20 years old to about 40, following the Venus age when one is aware of his seductive power. Temperament: Bilious Characterology: Emotive, Active, Secondary, passionate type. For more information, see the page dedicated to the Sun. Sun in Pisces Your deep intuition and your extreme sensitivity allow you to perceive naturally what others understand through analysis. You do not follow the norms in use, societal or educational models and you prefer to create a moral for yourself. A feeling of isolation may come from your ability to live emotions that are unknown to your entourage. This strong impressionability endows you with a sixth sense and acute feelings. In some circumstances, distance and detachment are needed in order not to get bogged down in the necessities of the moment, in useless transient struggles and in barren conflicts. Pisces work wonders. Your strength: a sharp intuition of underlying stakes, a sensitivity that turns ""the spirit of the times"" into a real compass. All activities requiring stepping back are suitable for you. Before anyone else, you pick up the dangers of an adventure, the risks of defeats or of suspension... with your clear-sightedness more than due to pessimism. Therefore, you may abandon an objective that is not yet obsolete. It is important that you protect yourself against unnecessary disenchantments. Pisces hide a perceptiveness that many claim to possess. But your low-key advices are formulated in a peculiar language. The person who can understand your dazzling intuitions is very lucky. Sun Dominant If the Sun is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Solarian: you loathe pettiness and Machiavellian manoeuvre, and you are fond of natural nobleness as well as of direct and honest attitudes. You endeavour to get out of muddled or dark situations as quickly as possible. Your need for transparency may lead you to make cut-and-dried judgments such as yes or no, and black or white. However, your honesty commands your entourage's consideration. At times, you come across as authoritarian. It is true that you never want to be thought of the notable absentee, and that you manage to make people pay attention to you, as well as to your plans and your assessments. To this end, the Solarian sometimes develops a great talent for placing himself under the spotlight without missing a single opportunity to arouse interest. Some other Solarians, although more discreet, still manage to be the focus of any debate, even in situations of exclusion. It is your way of being present even though you are actually not there... More than other people, you appreciate the esteem extended to you. It is useless to cheat with you, since in all areas you consider establishing enduring relationships only with those who love you, admire you, respect you, or express some degree of affection to you. Your will to straighten out your inter-personal relationships is your strength and sometimes, your Achilles' heel. You cannot achieve anything behind the scenes. Therefore, your comportment is marked with heroism, and your stands are devoid of ambiguity, in the sense that your commitments are unfailing, and your rebuffs, final. Interpretation of the 10° Pisces symbolic degree ""A man and a woman reclining on a Roman bed cheerfully partake wine and fruits."" (Janduz version) Sensual, fickle, and impulsive character overindulging in sensuality and the pleasures of the table, shamelessly. One becomes quickly infatuated and gets bored as rapidly. Constantly going from one partner to another only brings about increasing frustrations. One must understand the difference between sex and love, and that the former is most unlikely to last forever. If one does not pull oneself together, some day, one may wake up, in poor health, to find out that years have gone by, and that one is left with a meaningless life. Although Pisces is considered a mute sign, this degree indicates that gossips cause serious troubles and that bad reputation threatens men and women alike. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.

For a man, she represents his mother and later his wife, and his relationship with women in general. For a woman, the Moon is almost as important as the Sun and the Ascendant. Her element is water, she is cold and moist, she rules Cancer, is in exaltation in Taurus and is in analogy with the stomach. She symbolizes the mother, wife, the crowd, the Moon is associated with birth and childhood. Tradition also matches her with the end of life, after Saturn the old age, it is thus customary to go back to one's place of birth to die: the end of life meets the very beginning. Temperament: Lymphatic Characterology: Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Non-Emotive, non Active and Primary, Nervous or Amorphous type. For more information, see the page dedicated to the Moon. Moon in Scorpio On the day and at the time of your birth, the Moon was in the sign of Scorpio. Your instincts deeply influence your thinking process and your actions. There is a lot of impulsiveness and violence in you. But they are only the other side of the coin of your direct and innate receptivity that gives you the amazing ability to perceive what is really at stake in any given situation. You also have extraordinary psychological skills. You are impervious to prevailing trends and tastes and you prefer to create a unique lifestyle for yourself alone. You are very selective in your intimate sphere and you accept as friends only the persons who can be naturally integrated in your quite special realm. You carefully maintain your distance with all intruders. Closeness needs time. Moon Dominant If the Moon is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Lunarian: the driving force behind your actions is mainly the pursuit of well-being and tranquillity. Your sensitive and romantic self lives on those periods of rest during which you let your imagination wander at will. This is your way of finding inspiration and balance. Nothing is allowed to disturb your feeling of fulfilment and security within a harmonious cell, be it a family or a clan. More than other people, the Lunarian is attached to those moments during which one forgets one's worries and lets oneself cast adrift aimlessly, with no other goal than to be lulled into an ambiance, a situation, or a perfect moment. Many people do not understand such absences and their meaning, which is to regain strength. These people readily describe you with such unflattering terms as apathy and nonchalance. Never mind! Some inspirations require surrendering as well as striking a balance derived from alternate action and passivity. Your qualities are expressed to the fullest in situations which demand familiarity and privacy. Your capacities to respect and blend into your environment is at least as valuable as some other people's aggressive dispositions. However, you are well-advised to avoid indolence and renunciation out of laziness or indifference. Interpretation of the 6° Scorpio symbolic degree ""As he tills his field with a spade, a young man finds a diamond."" (Janduz version) This degree indicates that wealth is acquired through sheer luck. It might be an old treasure hidden by forebears, or an unexpected bequest. The natal chart indicates if one is able to increase the riches granted, or if one squanders them. Occupations dealing with precious stones, ores, and anything buried in the earth are extremely favoured and bring about the kind of success one had never dared to imagine, even in the wildest dreams. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Mercury Aspects Mercury semi-square Mars orb -0°18' Mercury bi-quintile Ascendant orb +0°42' Mercury opposite Jupiter orb -8°58' Mercury quintile Saturn orb +1°00' Mercury 15°44' Aquarius Mercury represents communication, logical and rational mind, intellectual skills. Earth is its element, it is cold and dry, and it rules Virgo and Gemini, is in exaltation in Virgo and is in analogy with the arms, hands, nervous system. It represents tradesmen, lawyers, messengers; the age of Mercury goes from 8 or 10 years old to about 15.. Temperament: Nervous Characterology: Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Non-Emotive, Active and Primary, Nervous or Sanguine type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Mercury. Mercury in Aquarius Mercury describes your relations, your communication skills and the way you relate to the external world. However, other astrological elements also influence these areas. The sign Mercury occupies is significant only if Mercury is part of your planetary dominantes. In your chart, Mercury is in Aquarius. Everything with a human tint catches your attention. You are sensitive to the specificities and the uniqueness of each individual and you feel you learn a lot whenever you meet with an open-minded and curious person. You do not get along well with stay-at-home and conservative people. As each relationship is constantly evolving, with time, it can, and it must, grow and offer surprises and potentials. On the human plane, you are very idealistic - sometimes even utopian - readily trusting and valuing persons who may not always be worth it. This is the drawback inherent to your highly commendable open-mindedness and your tolerance. Your ideas are original and liberal. In your communication, you display consideration and leniency and you acknowledge your interlocutor's differences. However, your understanding is not unconditional and you detach yourself from disappointing people whose values are incompatible with yours. To each, his own! Mercury Dominant If Mercury is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Mercurian: the tradition points out the importance of communication. From idle but enriching chatters to observation gift, such a dominant endows you with a wide range of expression. Human beings have one thousand facets and one thousand masks they wear according to circumstances and the fortunes of the game of life. You take the role of an observer who is avid for novelties, discoveries, and surprises. Everything catches your attention and becomes an opportunity for new encounters, relationships, and learning. The world amazes you, amuses you sometimes, and stimulates your curiosity. Because the most important thing is to discover, and because you consider that each new situation is packed with potentialities, you try to fill the gaps in your knowledge. Although your open-mindedness may scatter your centres of interest, it also enables you to carefully avoid sticking to only one immutable and rigid view. The slightest sign enables you to perceive the other side of the coin, as well as the infinite complexity of people and of situations. On the human plane, you seek the dialogue and the information without which you know that you are not able to fully grasp the nature of your interlocutor. This keen interest in the Unknown sharpens your inter-relational skills. All these qualities are traditionally associated with Mercury. Interpretation of the 15° Aquarius symbolic degree ""A boat sets sail at full speed towards the sun rising at the horizon while on the shore, two men riding a unicorn and a sea dragon are watching."" (Janduz version) Ambitious, enterprising, and nice character. Success, fame, and wealth can be achieved in the exploration of unknown territories and all kinds of journeys. One must be very careful in the selection of business partners because there is a danger of being taken advantage of, particularly by people who do not belong to the same social circle. This degree warns against possible swindles and violent death, whether one is the perpetrator or the victim. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.

Venus Aspects Venus trine Jupiter orb +2°10' Venus trine Pluto orb +4°30' Venus opposite Neptune orb -7°39' Venus square Uranus orb +6°12' Venus 22°32' Aries Venus represents the way one loves, relationships, sharing, affectivity, seductive ability. For men, she also corresponds to the kind of woman he's attracted to (but not especially in marriage which is more symbolized by the Moon, Venus is the lover and not the wife). Her element is the Air, she is moist, rules Taurus and Libra, is in exaltation in Pisces and is in analogy with the kidneys, the venous system, the bladder, the neck. She represents the artists, tradesmen, occupations linked to beauty and charm; the age of Venus goes from 15 to about 25 years old. Temperament: Sanguine and Lymphatic Characterology: Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Emotive, non Active and Secondary type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Venus. Venus in Aries Venus describes your affective life. On the day of your birth, she is found in Aries. This configuration endows your affectivity with spring freshness: sensuality constantly on the alert and emotionalism all on edge. In the amorous sphere, you experience frequent, lively and burning excitements. You do not like half-measures and your feelings are marked with sustained exclusive passion and affective fieriness. Love is a conquest and an ongoing renewed charm offensive. The indispensable passion can emerge only when your amorous relationships include clashes, rivalries and challenges. Your affective ideal? Chivalry, with your heart triumphing over obstacles. Your feelings are as filled with spring as the sign of Aries. They are exalted when you find and when you are amazed by the person you long for. Love is a process of constant renewal. Your problem is to maintain the intensity of your feelings, the freshness of first times, of new encounters and new experiences. The fire of passion must be fuelled, over and over again. Routine and security are the enemies of love. Life together is something that must be earned and deserved: you must be as charming as on the first day. Beware of irresistible love at first sight, when passion is opposed to reason. Venus Dominant If Venus is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Venusian: you are a sensual and emotional person particularly receptive to the natural likes and dislikes aroused by your contact with people. You are prone to frequent instinctive aversions and true passions which are exclusively driven by the feeling of love. The heart has its reasons which Reason knows nothing of... Your balance is based on the richness of your affective life. Without love, the Venusian is resourceless, lost, and deprived of any reason for living. You have an obvious and strong will to charm and to arouse the attachments without which you cannot properly function. Every area of your life is thus marked by your affectivity. The danger is that you may ""be taken in"" by charm. In such cases, you would prefer to keep your emotions under better control. Thus, hyper-sensitivity has its own inconveniences. Nevertheless, better than anyone else, you know how to play with feelings and attractions. Although you are sometimes caught in the traps of an over sensitive emotionalism, feelings remain your best assets in many circumstances. There is another aspect to the Venusian dominant. According to the Tradition, this planet rules the Arts, and you are endowed with some degree of artistic dispositions, ranging from good to excellent. Interpretation of the 22° Aries symbolic degree ""A carefree man, seated on the corner of a table with a glass of wine in his hand, admires the colour of the wine through the sunlight, while at another table, his two friends seem to be plotting against him. Nearby, two groups of three snakes fight against each other."" (Janduz version) Refined, benevolent, and impressionable character. Because one lacks willpower, one often allows other people to take decisions. One does not have the heart to break up even though so-called friends prove to be harmful and covet one's spouse or romantic partner, one's wealth or one's position at work. However, the snakes represent protective occult powers which are readily available, provided that one displays willpower and fortitude.

For a woman, Mars corresponds to the kind of man she's attracted to (but not especially in marriage which is rather symbolized by the Sun, Mars is the lover, not the husband). Fire is its element, it is hot and dry, and it rules Aries and Scorpio (along with Pluto), is in exaltation with Capricorn and is in analogy with the muscles and the spleen. It represents the soldiers, sportsmen, warriors, surgeons, blacksmiths... ; the age of Mars goes from 42 to 50 years old. Temperament: Bilious Characterology: Emotive, Active, Primary type. It is a Choleric. For more information, see the page dedicated to Mars. Mars in Capricorn The planet Mars indicates how you react to life concrete stimulations. It also describes your fighting spirit, your abilities to stand for yourself and to take action. With Mars in Capricorn, your fortitude is quite exceptional. You strive to control your passions and your instincts and to keep a cool-head under all circumstances. This is probably the reason of your strength. You show firmness with others and with yourself. In the course of an action, you are able to make sustainable, strong and well-structured efforts. You may be criticized for your lack of adaptability. Your first reaction is to immutably remain your true self. This propensity to stability, although it may slow down your initiatives, is very valuable, in many circumstances: your reactions are in line with your own values and you are not destabilized by prevailing trends and fleeting fashions... and by advice given to you! Mars Dominant If Mars is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Marsian: in your hand-to-hand struggle for life, you demonstrate an acute and active sense of confrontation with the world, with other people, and with your own destiny. You need to take action and to fight for your projects and your desires. You perceive all situations with deep intensity, and you react to the here and now without bothering to step back in order to ensure that events are under your control. You take up challenges with excessive foolhardiness as a consequence of your impulsiveness. However, better than anyone else, you know how to mobilise your resources in case of crisis. You take action whenever it is necessary to do so, and you are present in a timely manner. With Mars, your attitudes are dictated by the realities of the moment, by your emotions, and by everything which proved to have worked in the past. When this dominant is not well integrated, it may bring about an aggressive or impulsive behaviour. Therefore, you must learn to control your hyper-sensitivity and your fits of temper. You are also endowed with Marsian qualities: the fighting spirit and the taste for duel without which one may find oneself overwhelmed by events. When this willpower is well channelled, its precious energy enables to cope with all sorts of contingencies. There are a thousand ways to win, and a thousand challenges to take up with the enthusiasm and the dynamism which make life so worthy. A certain idea of life which is wild, passionate, and in tune with events. Interpretation of the 1° Capricorn symbolic degree ""Two men get out of a house carrying a reed on their shoulder as if it were a heavy burden. On the roof, the weathercock points to no particular direction."" (Janduz version) Futile, restless, and indecisive character. Huge efforts are made even though the task requires none. Owing to procrastination, nice opportunities are missed. Furthermore, many good initiatives are doomed to failure for lack of perseverance. Life is most likely to unfold in precariousness and to end up in sadness, unless one decides to become serious and display tenacity, straight away.

Its element is Air, it is hot and moist, and it rules Sagittarius and Pisces (along with Neptune), is in exaltation with Cancer and is in analogy with the hips and endocrinal system. It represents the governors, magistrates, professors, religious men too; the age of Jupiter goes from 50 to 55 or even 70 years old. Temperament: Sanguine Characterology: Emotive, Active, Primary type; it is an extrovert Choleric. Actually the humid version of Mars, inclined to action like him. For more information, see the page dedicated to Jupiter. Jupiter in Leo The planet Jupiter symbolizes expansion, broadness and generosity. Jupiter is associated with the functions of synthesis, enthusiasm and optimism. In your natal chart, his house position is more important than his sign position because, like Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Jupiter in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. Jupiter in Leo gives you a strong inclination for luxury, arts, parties and shows: your nature is fond of leisure, preferably in noble, proud, even dramatic ways. You feel comfortable in the field of entertainment. You love children, laughters and splendour... Your creativity is often remarkable. Jupiter Dominant If Jupiter is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Jupiterian: because this planet brings about a keen interest in social and professional success, the Tradition considers it to be beneficial. Indeed, you know how to adjust to events and to jump at the chance when it arises. The members of your entourage gladly entrust you with high responsibilities because they are often impressed by your learning skills and your adaptation abilities as you deal with new structures and new languages. What is the secret of your good star? It is your self-confidence which wins public support. Now, what is the secret of your charm? Definitely, enthusiasm, euphoria, and exaltation. Exaggeration also. When this dominant is well integrated, it is a factor of affluence and optimism, and a certain degree of joviality enables you to easily fit into various spheres. It constitutes your main asset to manage your life. However, you must at times curb your desire for integration, lest your sense of opportunity turns into extreme opportunism. Here also, the key to success lies in a correct estimate of everyone's chances and possibilities. Although management is one of your forte, and you can adjust your objectives to current realities better than other people, you lack the hindsight which enables you to avoid short-term vagaries and daily fluctuations. If you strive too much to adapt, you run a risk of betraying yourself. This is the other traditional side of the coin with ""The Greater Benefic""! Interpretation of the 24° Leo symbolic degree ""At the edge of a thick forest, a man ploughs his field with two strong and docile oxen."" (Janduz version) Quiet, patient, and determined character. One has strong ties with the soil. One is intelligent and ready to work hard to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for the improvement of one's position. Life unfolds happily and comfortably although one is unlikely to rise to a very prominent place. One enjoys a good health throughout life.

Earth is its element, it is cold and dry, and it rules Capricorn and Aquarius (along with Uranus), is in exaltation in Libra and is in analogy with the bones (skeleton) and the skin. It represents the grandparents, old people, scientists, knowledgeable men, Saturn corresponds to old age; it goes from 70 years old until death. Temperament: Nervous Characterology: Non-Emotive, Active and Secondary type or Emotive, non Active and Secondary type or sometimes Non-Emotive, non Active and Secondary type; it is a Phlegmatic, a Sentimental or an Empathic type For more information, see the page dedicated to Saturn. Saturn in Sagittarius The planet Saturn symbolizes contraction, effort, time, limitation and concentration. Saturn eliminates anything that is not authentic, sooner or later. It is impossible to cheat him as he gives an irresistible desire to form a coherent whole with oneself, in responsible and wise ways. He is the great purifier. He represents our limitations but also our truth. In your natal chart, the house position where Saturn is posited is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Saturn in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. Saturn in Sagittarius limits your taste for exoticism and for rebellion. On the other hand, he strengthens your sense of responsibilities and your authority. You focus on what is concrete and real and you avoid venturing into unknown territories. Saturn Dominant If Saturn is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Saturnian: you gladly leave to other people the decision to take life as it comes. As far as you are concerned, you prefer to take advantage of your experiences in order to discover, to grow, and to question yourself. Interpretation of the 2° Sagittarius symbolic degree ""At the top of the stairs of a temple, a Madonna blesses worshippers and enemies alike."" (Janduz version) Wise, gentle, and devoted character endowed with great intellectual capacities. Outstanding success can be achieved in any professional pursuit, particularly in education, medicine, finance, diplomacy, or religion. This degree indicates that one's light shines bright and attracts numerous friends and supporters. Moral virtue and success often arouse jealousy, and ill-intentioned people try to damage one's reputation through personal attacks, but in vain, because nobleness of heart and sincerity protect against slanders.

Fire is its element, it is dry, and it rules Aquarius, is in exaltation with Scorpio and is in analogy with the brain and the nerves. It represents inventors, odd characters, revolutionaries. Temperament: Nervous to the extreme Characterology: Emotive, Active, Secondary type; it is a Passionate type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Uranus. Uranus in Cancer The planet Uranus symbolizes originality, independence and cerebral energy bursting suddenly. Uranus triggers the irresistible need for freedom that we have in ourselves. Uranus tends to break the constraints that have become unbearable and gives us the courage and the will to get rid of what has become a burden; when he is well aspected, he also indicates genius. In your natal chart, Uranus' house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Uranus in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Uranus in Cancer tends to intellectualize your emotions and to detach you from affective considerations. He may bring about sudden surprises and changes within your family or your home in several instances of your life. Uranus Dominant If Uranus is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Uranian: personal values are prevailing. Inner certainties fuel an inflexible will and a desire to call attention on yourself as well as to follow your beliefs through. This planet prompts you to behave with determination, to put forward your own truth, and to start your personal revolution. More than other people, you are willing to keep some degree of autonomy in all circumstances, and you often display an individualistic nature. In order to achieve your ideal of freedom and independence, you may act like a despot as you try to convince and to impose your views, whether smoothly or forcefully. Regardless of the flexibility of your comportment, some situations demand an absolute firmness as well as uncompromising, frank and straightforward attitudes. People may criticise you for your intransigence and say that you are a hardliner. Outsider's opinions don't matter! The most important thing is that you act in all conscience and reach your primary objectives. More than anyone else, you know how to use your willpower and to focus your energy on a precise aim, relentlessly, whatever the consequences might be. In the chapter of qualities, let's mention a definite sense of responsibility, an innovative mind open to techniques and modern ideas, as well as a natural self-discipline which overcomes many an obstacle. Therefore, people are well-advised not to hound you into a corner. Interpretation of the 28° Cancer symbolic degree ""A tiger crawls towards a horse tethered to a tree."" (Janduz version) Instinctive, passionate but easy-going character endowed with sharp intellectual faculties, a subtle mind, and numerous gifts. Fateful events, or plots engineered by jealous people may seriously limit one's freedom and even threaten one's life, should the natal chart concur. It is indispensable to be on one's guard.

Water is its element, it is moist, it rules Pisces, is in exaltation in Cancer, though some authors say it is Leo, and is in analogy with the vegetative system. It represents dreamers, mediums, magicians, merchants of illusion, drug addicts. Temperament: rather Lymphatic Characterology: Emotive, non Active, Primary or Secondary type; it is a Sentimental, or sometimes Amorphous type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Neptune. Neptune in Scorpio The planet Neptune symbolizes extreme receptivity, intense emotional sharpness, impressionability and inspiration; it is the planet of mediums, mystics and religious faith. In an astrological chart, it indicates dilution, vagueness, understanding one's environment through emotions and the absence of clear and determined limits and structures. In your natal chart, Neptune's house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Neptune in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning.

In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Neptune in Scorpio amplifies your emotions and adds more affectivity into your sexuality. Your fantasies have no limit and you revel in mysteries... Neptune Dominant If Neptune is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Neptunian: your intuition is highly developed. You are of a contemplative nature, and you are particularly receptive to ambiances, places, and people. You gladly cultivate the art of letting-go, and you allow the natural unfolding of events to construct your world. You follow your inspirations, for better or for worse. At times, you display an extraordinary clairvoyance gift. You seem to be able to read your subconscious like a book, and you track down subtle underlying mechanisms, flaws, or open breaches. This innate intuition might explain the strokes of good luck which the Neptunian is sometimes credited with. However, you may also be the victim of illusions and misleading intuitions. You are an idealist, and you let your deepest aspirations prevail over the realities of the moment. Then, you set off in quest of some quixotic objective, living like a Don Quixote who relentlessly pursues an impossible dream. You have a great talent for psychology and the mysteries of the human soul. Since you instinctively perceive people's intents and motivations, as you swim in the complexity of human nature, you feel in your element. The subtlety of your perceptiveness is the source of both special affections and irrevocable rejections. What is the danger of such a dominant? If it is not offset by other influences in your natal chart, you may not have an iron will. Your trump card is your instinct, which may be developed to the extent that it becomes clairvoyance. Interpretation of the 0° Scorpio symbolic degree ""A wounded man lies at the feet of an armed warrior beside a chest brimming with jewels."" (Janduz version) Foolhardy, combative, and intransigent character. One does not hesitate to get involved in conflicts, no matter how dangerous they might be. There is a strong probability of violence and accident, whether one is the perpetrator or the victim. If aggressive instincts are constructively canalised, one may be entrusted with a position of authority and achieve success through acts of bravery.

Its element is indefinite; burning (like lava in fusion ?), it rules Scorpio, is in exaltation in Pisces and is in analogy with the sexual organs and excretion. It represents dictators, sadistic people, violent characters, is instinctive and powerful but also mysterious with hidden strengths. Temperament: rather Bilious Characterology: Emotive or non-Emotive, Active, Primary type; it is a Passionate Choleric type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Pluto. Pluto in Leo The planet Pluto symbolizes deep disruptions and upheavals, domination and sexual instincts, and the inner power we have in ourselves. Pluto destroys in order to reconstruct and he provokes painful crises that are needed in metamorphosis. Pluto is our deepest instincts' brutal force. It is the hidden and unconscious violence that can explode in us with incredible intensity before being projected in our actions; in itself, the planet is not negative: the might and the intensity of its energy are beyond the conceivable but it can be funnelled. Pluto is the only possibility we have at our disposal to overcome our inner blocks and to eliminate outgrown situations that have become inextricable. Pluto's energy is valuable because of its usefulness for the irreversible destruction of what constitutes a problem and not because of its negative side and its perversity. Pluto allows to reconstruct and to regenerate parts of our personality or whole stretches of our life, provided that we manage to funnel his wild energy and to step back. It is impossible to tame this energy, given its essence. However, it is possible to take advantage of it for a precise aim, through a temporary identification of some parts of us with this energy. In such a case, the outcome is our final evolution and even, our transformation. In your natal chart, Pluto's house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, Pluto is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Pluto in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality and they are not to be really taken into account, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Pluto in Leo may give you an authoritarian and, even, despotic nature. But your charisma and your radiance are intensified. Pluto Dominant If Pluto is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Plutonian: you sometimes feel like a foreigner who does not belong to the world, to its laws, and its concerns. The rules of life in society are not necessarily yours. You are interested in what is unknown and in the subtle laws of a hidden order. So, you take malicious pleasure in ridiculing the patterns you find too simplistic or too rigid. You also revel in underlining the limits of explanations you deem too common. There is something unconventional about the way you are, the way you think, and the way you act. What is your specificity made of? Is it an extraordinary partner? A life off the beaten path? Or do you only distance yourself from conventional morals? In any case, you have the feeling, sometimes quite vague, that you come from nowhere, and that you do not belong to any definite group... In short, it means that you cannot be simplified in order to conform to existing models. The gap between you and ordinary mortals is also an element of your strength. Your deep clear-sightedness, firstly, enables you to put things into perspective and to grant them only the attention they deserve. Your other remarkable asset is your capacity to intervene from behind the scenes, to secretly organise events, and to bring about the desirable outcome without seeming to impose or to dictate anything. However, you must still overcome one of the major difficulties of this dominant, which is to get people to accept your difference and to smoothly fit into your environment. Interpretation of the 27° Leo symbolic degree ""Two golden circles tied by a blue ribbon flutter above two men and a woman walking in the countryside."" (Janduz version) Benevolent, cheerful, and pleasant character. Life is peaceful and happy. One perfectly blends idealism with earthly needs, as described by the two united golden circles. This degree indicates nice friends, wealth, and fulfilled ambitions. The second part of life is enlightened by spirituality. Two marriages are possible.

Most astrologers consider it as a kind of ""mediator"" between Saturn and outer planets. Consequently, Chiron is of Saturn's nature and at the same time is influenced by Uranus, the first slow-moving planet. Astrologically, it symbolizes wisdom, patience and the faculty to reduce others' sufferings: it is said to be the ""great healer"" of the zodiac. Like all the secondary bodies, it must be in close conjunction with planets or angles in order to fully express its action. %TEXTES_22% %DYNAMIQUE_23% Ceres, the biggest of the four minor asteroids used besides Chiron, is associated with the mythological goddess of growing plants and harvest and also symbolizes physical constitution, vitality and fertility. She's also known as Demeter, according to the astrologer Zipporah Dobyns, linked to the symbolism of the mother but in a less emotive and more physical way than the Moon. Ceres is thought to be the ruler of Virgo, in exaltation in Gemini, in exile in Pisces and in fall in Sagittarius. Keywords associated with Ceres could be order, practical sense, worry, precision, modesty, method, sobriety, motherhood, fertility, the Earth: a kind of a more cerebral Moon... %TEXTES_23% %DYNAMIQUE_24% Pallas is sometimes used in modern Astrology: she represents intelligence, abstract and global thinking talents. It is usually considered to be a determining element in political strategy. %TEXTES_24% %DYNAMIQUE_25% Juno is the asteroid corresponding to the adaptation to the marital partner and to the defence of individual rights; it is thus used in the field of marriage. %TEXTES_25% %DYNAMIQUE_26% Vesta is rarely used and brings the ability to efficiently devote oneself to a cause. %TEXTES_26% True North Node 12°43' Я Sagittarius The North Node (True Node here) represents the goals that must be achieved during life, in the karmic sense according to some traditions. Its position in house indicates in what field an effort is necessary in order to evolve. The North Node is often called the Dragon's head, it is usually considered beneficial, a bit like Jupiter with the planets. The Lunar nodes are fictional points and not actual heavenly bodies: they are the intersections of the Moon with the Ecliptic (the path made by the Sun in its orbit as seen from the Earth). The axis of the Lunar nodes moves 19 degrees each year, namely a bit more than three minutes each day. The South Node is diametrically opposed to the North Node, therefore it faces it (it's not drawn here, it's the same symbol but upside down). It symbolizes what has already been achieved or acquired, in a karmic sense: it's the past from which it's advised to move on in order to progress. The South Node is rather negative, of a Saturnian nature: the experience through suffering. Interpretation of the 12° Sagittarius symbolic degree ""A man standing outside of a prison watches its closed door."" (Janduz version) Withdrawn, misanthropic, and introverted character. The prison symbolises frustrations stemming from constraints and separation. One may be estranged from a family member who is living in a secluded place, or who is sick. The other possibility is that the members of the entourage do not understand one's intellectual, aesthetic, scientific, or altruistic aspirations. Nevertheless, one is capable of achieving success in the field of one's choice. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports. True Lilith 16°11' Я Capricorn Lilith or the Dark Moon (True Lilith here) represents the uncrossable threshold, taboos, the individual's provocative and fascinating side, including on a sexual level. She symbolizes violence and ""untameability"", the radical and deep-seated refusal to submit. The keywords for Lilith can be sterility, sadism, perversity, castration, sadomasochism, eroticism, orgasm, forbidden fantasies, marginality, cruelty; redemption, illumination, rebelliousness... Lilith's opposite point is called Priapus; it is the Lunar perigee, the position where the Moon is closest to the Earth. It symbolizes man's primitive nature, the horror hidden in our deepest self; masochism, extreme sensuality, impulsiveness, irrationality and excess. Physically speaking, the Dark Moon is the focal point unoccupied by the Earth: it is not a concrete body but a mathematical point. Interpretation of the 16° Capricorn symbolic degree ""A king in ceremonial costume is greeted by a courtier who bows down in reverence."" (Janduz version) Obliging, persistent, and provident character. Owing to one's human qualities and professional skills, one is entrusted with a high-level position, or one earns an electoral mandate. It is also possible that one meets a person wielding power who grants his protection and brings about wealth. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports. %DYNAMIQUE_29% The Part of Fortune is an ancient concept, used by Ptolemy and other astrologers before him. Firstly, it has nothing to do with fortune! In modern astrology, it is actually used to enhance a planet or angle when in close conjunction with it: it thus amplifies the meaning associated to the point affected by its presence. It is calculated in the following way: Part of Fortune = AS + Moon - Sun (it is the Moons position when the Sun rises) The classical Part of Fortune, of which the calculus method is unchanged whether in a diurnal or nocturnal chart, is usually distinguished from the diurnal/nocturnal Part of Fortune which is calculated by the formula AS + Sun - Moon for a nocturnal chart, and AS + Moon - Sun in a diurnal chart. We currently use the latter formula for our astrological programmes. For more information, see the page dedicated to the Arabian parts. %TEXTES_29% %DYNAMIQUE_30% The First House or Ascendant represents one's behaviour in the eyes of others, and also one's health.

Its interpretation is controversial, because certain astrologers pay no attention to it. The Vertex is sometimes considered to be the second Descendant because, like the latter, it is related to communication and exchanges. It has to do with associations and fated encounters, those that are not chosen, and reveals the type of sensitivity and reactivity we have in our dealings with other people: a refined and tolerant way in Libra, straightforward and spontaneous in Aries, etc. %TEXTES_44% %DYNAMIQUE_45% The East Point is a fictitious point at the intersection of two great circles, the Ecliptic and the great vertical circle (Prime Vertical) in the East of the birthplace, linking the East, the Zenith, the West, and the Nadir.

They are, by no means, of a personal nature. This principle is valid for the 70,131 celebrities included in our database. These texts provide the meanings of planets, or combination of planets, in signs and in houses, as well as the interpretations of planetary dominants in line with modern Western astrology rules. Moreover, since Astrotheme is not a polemic website, no negative aspect which may damage the good reputation of a celebrity is posted here, unlike in the comprehensive astrological portrait. Introduction Here are some character traits from Dalia Grybauskaite's birth chart. This description is far from being comprehensive but it can shed light on his/her personality, which is still interesting for professional astrologers or astrology lovers. In a matter of minutes, you can get at your email address your astrological portrait (approximately 32 pages), a much more comprehensive report than this portrait of Dalia Grybauskaite. N.B.: as this celebrity's birth time is unknown, the chart is arbitrarily calculated for 12:00 PM - the legal time for his/her place of birth; since astrological houses are not taken into account, this astrological profile excerpt is less detailed than those for which the birth time is known. The dominant planets of Dalia Grybauskaite When interpreting a natal chart, the best method is to start gradually from general features to specific ones. Thus, there is usually a plan to be followed, from the overall analysis of the chart and its structure, to the description of its different character traits. In the first part, an overall analysis of the chart enables us to figure out the personality's main features and to emphasize several points that are confirmed or not in the detailed analysis: in any case, those general traits are taken into account. Human personality is an infinitely intricate entity and describing it is a complex task. Claiming to rapidly summarize it is illusory, although it does not mean that it is an impossible challenge. It is essential to read a natal chart several times in order to absorb all its different meanings and to grasp all this complexity. But the exercise is worthwhile. In brief, a natal chart is composed of ten planets: two luminaries, the Sun and the Moon, three fast-moving or individual planets, Mercury, Venus and Mars, two slow-moving planets, Jupiter and Saturn, and three very slow-moving planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Additional secondary elements are: the Lunar Nodes, the Dark Moon or Lilith, Chiron and other minor objects. They are all posited on the Zodiac wheel consisting of twelve signs, from Aries to Pisces, and divided into twelve astrological houses. The first step is to evaluate the importance of each planet. This is what we call identifying the dominant planets. This process obeys rules that depend on the astrologer's sensitivity and experience but it also has precise and steady bases: thus, we can take into account the parameters of a planet's activity (the number of active aspects a planet forms, the importance of each aspect according to its nature and its exactness), angularity parameters; (proximity to the four angles, Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant and Imum Coeli or Nadir, all of them being evaluated numerically, according to the kind of angle and the planet-angle distance) and quality parameters (rulership, exaltation, exile and fall). Finally, other criteria such as the rulership of the Ascendant and the Midheaven etc. are important. These different criteria allow a planet to be highlighted and lead to useful conclusions when interpreting the chart. The overall chart analysis begins with the observation of three sorts of planetary distributions in the chart: Eastern or Western hemisphere, Northern or Southern hemisphere, and quadrants (North-eastern, North-western, South-eastern and South-western). These three distributions give a general tone in terms of introversion and extraversion, willpower, sociability, and behavioural predispositions. Advertisements Then, there are three additional distributions: elements (called triplicity since there are three groups of signs for each one) - Fire, Air, Earth and Water - corresponding to a character typology, modality (or quadruplicity with four groups of signs for each one) - Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable - and polarity (Yin and Yang). There are three types of dominants: dominant planets, dominant signs and dominant houses. The novice thinks astrology means only ""to be Aries"" or sometimes, for example, ""to be Aries Ascendant Virgo"". It is actually far more complex. Although the Sun and the Ascendant alone may reveal a large part of the character - approximately a third or a half of your psychological signature, a person is neither ""just the Sun"" (called the sign) nor just ""the first house"" (the Ascendant). Thus, a particular planet's influence may be significantly increased; a particular sign or house may contain a group of planets that will bring nuances and sometimes weaken the role of the Ascendant, of the Sun sign etc. Lastly, there are two other criteria: accentuations (angular, succedent and cadent) which are a classification of astrological houses and types of decanates that are occupied (each sign is divided into three decanates of ten degrees each). They provide some additional informations. These general character traits must not be taken literally; they are, somehow, preparing for the chart reading. They allow to understand the second part of the analysis, which is more detailed and precise. It focuses on every area of the personality and provides a synthesis of all the above-mentioned parameters according to sound hierarchical rules. Warning: when the birth time is unknown, which is the case for Dalia Grybauskaite, a few paragraphs become irrelevant; distributions in hemispheres and quadrants are meaningless, so are dominant houses and houses' accentuations. Therefore, some chapters are removed from this part. For all paragraphs, the criteria for valuation are calculated without taking into account angles and rulerships of the Ascendant and of the Midheaven. The methodology retains its validity, but it is less precise without a time of birth. Elements and Modes for Dalia Grybauskaite The predominance of Water signs indicates high sensitivity and elevation through feelings, Dalia Grybauskaite. Your heart and your emotions are your driving forces, and you can't do anything on Earth if you don't feel a strong affective charge (as a matter of fact, the word ""feeling"" is essential in your psychology). You need to love in order to understand, and to feel in order to take action, to the detriment of a certain vulnerability against which you should learn to fight. Dalia Grybauskaite, Fire is dominant in your natal chart and endows you with intuition, energy, courage, self-confidence, and enthusiasm! You are inclined to be passionate, you assert your willpower, you move forward, and come hell or high water, you achieve your dreams and your goals. The relative weakness of this element is the difficulty to step back or a kind of boldness that may prompt you to do foolish things. The twelve zodiacal signs are split up into three groups or modes, called quadruplicities, a learned word meaning only that these three groups include four signs. The Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable modes are more or less represented in your natal chart, depending on planets' positions and importance, and on angles in the twelve signs. The Fixed mode corresponds to a majority of elements in your chart, Dalia Grybauskaite, and represents the desire for security and durability: you are able to concretely appreciate a situation and its stability. You definitely prefer to play the role of a loyal, obstinate and hard-working person, rather than to try new and risky experiences - beware, however, not to confuse obstinacy with intransigence. You structure, cement, and strengthen everything you find on your way: it is your nature, although you are not especially interested in swiftness: slow and steady... Advertisements Dominants: Planets, Signs and Houses for Dalia Grybauskaite The issue of dominant planets has existed since the mists of time in astrology: how nice it would be if a person could be described with a few words and one or several planets that would represent their character, without having to analyse such elements as rulerships, angularities, houses, etc! The ten planets - the Sun throughout Pluto - are a bit like ten characters in a role-play, each one has its own personality, its own way of acting, its own strengths and weaknesses. They actually represent a classification into ten distinct personalities, and astrologers have always tried to associate one or several dominant planets to a natal chart as well as dominant signs and houses. Indeed, it is quite the same situation with signs and houses. If planets symbolize characters, signs represent hues - the mental, emotional and physical structures of an individual. The sign in which a planet is posited is like a character whose features are modified according to the place where he lives. In a chart, there are usually one, two or three highlighted signs that allow to rapidly describe its owner. Regarding astrological houses, the principle is even simpler: the twelve houses correspond to twelve fields of life, and planets tenanting any given house increase that house's importance and highlight all relevant life departments: it may be marriage, work, friendship etc. In your natal chart, Dalia Grybauskaite, the ten main planets are distributed as follows: The three most important planets in your chart are Neptune, Mars and Jupiter. With Neptune as one of your three dominant planets, you are a secretive and ambiguous person, often confused or unclear about your own motivations! Indeed, you are endowed with unlimited imagination and inspiration, as well as with an extreme sensibility that may turn you into a psychic or a clairvoyant. On the other hand, your impressionability is such that you may have difficulties in separating what is concrete and solid from illusions or dreams. A mystic, a visionary or a poetess, you daydream, like any Neptunian, and you see what few people only can see, all of this being shrouded in aesthetic mists when you are fired with enthusiasm. A boundless, infinity-loving woman like you is inevitably likely to be more vulnerable and easily hurt because of your acute perception of events. In such cases, you are hit full in the face, and you may sink into gloomy daydreamings and dark melancholy. That said, this mysterious aura definitely gives you an indefinable charm in the eyes of your close friends who are often fascinated by your unique ability to feel and to see what ordinary people can never see! Mars is one of your dominant planets and provides you with its efficient energy and enthusiasm: with a powerful Mars in your chart, action - but also will and ability to undertake - is not an empty word for you. You are active, dynamic, willing to fight, courageous, and you are never afraid to move mountains, even though risks are part of the adventures that you start with determination. However, your patience is not always up to your boldness and a kind of feverishness, or even anger, can tarnish the quality of your achievements. That would be a pity since the Marsian is a champion in matters of efficiency! Mars symbolizes display of action, conquering spirit that favours discipline and order - beware of not being fussy - and lies at the frontier between action and brutality, between conquest and potential aggressiveness. Jupiter, the planet of expansion, organization, power and benevolence, is quite emphasized in your chart. Like any Jupiterian, you are warm, open, sociable, consensual, active and optimistic. You can use your self-confidence to erase differences of opinion, and you leave the task of analyzing and perfecting things to specialists. Your role, and you know it since you were young, is to gather, to demonstrate your synthesizing and conciliatory mind, and to naturally reap its fruits - power. You appreciate legality, social order but also order in general. With you as a leader, every plan or human entity can be organized and structured. You excel at supervising. The Jupiterian type is indeed the politician par excellence, and a positive Jupiter in your chart is synonymous with good integration into society, whatever the chosen path. Is this idyllic picture really perfect? Certainly not: each planet's typology has its own weaknesses. One of yours is pride, like the Solarian, but your will of expansion at all costs may generate a form of exaggeration in everything, endless pleasure, inappropriate self-confidence that could lead you to rough materialism and the thirst for absurd material comfort - in the worst cases, of course. In your natal chart, the three most important signs - according to criteria mentioned above - are in decreasing order of strength Scorpio, Leo and Capricorn. In general, these signs are important because your Ascendant",

"Egypt's president has said his country has proposed a two-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas during which four hostages held in Gaza would be freed. President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, speaking in Cairo, said the proposal also includes the release of some Palestinian prisoners and the delivery of humanitarian aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. Egypt has been a key mediator along with Qatar and the United States. This is the first time Egypt's president has publicly proposed such a plan.

"Pat Parker has been an unwavering advocate for Democratic presidential candidates in Michigan, a crucial swing state, through five grueling election cycles, and her experiences haven't always been filled with optimism. The exuberance she felt while canvassing for Barack Obama, marked by vibrant interactions with voters, was starkly contrasted by her time in a Hillary Clinton campaign office during the 2016 election in Saginaw County, an area deemed critical for Democrats, which felt eerily quiet and lifeless despite the widespread belief that Clinton would emerge victorious. The challenges faced while campaigning for Joe Biden were further compounded by the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, casting a shadow over the mobilization efforts. However, the upcoming election brings a different emotional landscape. For the first time in her extensive campaigning career, Parker is witnessing palpable fear among voters. Although the clinical social worker is filled with enthusiasm for Kamala Harris, she acknowledges that a significant portion of potential voters supporting Harris are being driven to the polls by fear of her opponent, Donald Trump. 'It's about him. There's a huge component of, 'We can't have him back, we've got to stop him.' Some conversations are really difficult. People get completely freaked out and upset, and it doesn't leave a lot of room for, 'What do you think of Harris?',' Parker explains. After Trump's 2020 defeat, many Americans held onto hopes that he would retreat from the political spotlight. However, the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, his ongoing attempts to undermine trust in the electoral system, and the enduring ramifications of his presidency—including the erosion of abortion rights—have ensured that Trump remains an influential figure in American politics. In this election cycle, Parker observes that the intensity of fear has only escalated. Trump has issued menacing proclamations about dismantling democracy, mobilizing the military against the so-called 'enemy within,' and weaponizing the justice system to enact revenge on those he perceives to have wronged him. His campaign rallies, often charged with vitriol against immigrants—many of whom reside in the US legally—and ominous threats to deport millions, have only heightened this climate of fear. 'We watch him. It's like you can't keep your eyes off a fire,' Parker reflects. In Michigan, residents are bombarded with a barrage of campaign advertisements and high-energy rallies as Harris and Trump engage in a fierce battle for every vote in a state where polls indicate they are closely matched. The Harris campaign views Michigan, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as essential to their chances of securing victory, emphasizing that turnout will be the critical factor in this fight. Trump's successful capture of these 'blue wall' states in the 2016 election, winning Michigan by a razor-thin margin of just 10,704 votes, changed the electoral landscape significantly. In the succeeding 2020 election, Trump increased his support in these states, yet ultimately lost to Biden. This was largely due to a surge of Democratic voters who had previously abstained from voting, resulting in a historic turnout where 72% of registered voters cast ballots in Michigan—the highest proportion since JFK's election 60 years prior. Indicators point toward an even higher turnout this year, with Michigan county clerks noting a rise in voter registration and nearly 1 million postal ballots returned, predominantly from Democratic strongholds like Detroit. However, the Harris campaign remains cautiously optimistic, fully aware of the lessons ingrained from the 2016 campaign debacle where Clinton failed to engage Michigan voters actively. Clinton's team neglected to prioritize the state or connect with vital demographics, such as unionized workers and Black communities, traditionally aligned with the Democratic Party. Their misplaced confidence, based on polling data suggesting a comfortable lead, resulted in tragic oversights, leading to her defeat in Michigan and several other battlegrounds. In stark contrast, Harris is dedicating significant time to campaigning in Michigan, second only to Pennsylvania. The vice president, alongside her running mate Tim Walz, is actively engaging various voter blocs, including factory workers, Black citizens, white suburban women, and college students, making an effort to connect with all corners of the electorate. To bolster her campaign, Harris notably brought former President Barack Obama to a Detroit rally, where he engaged with mega-star Eminem, and enlisted Bernie Sanders to reassure student voters concerned about her alignment with corporate interests. Harris's efforts also extend to attracting anti-Trump Republicans, including backing from former Republican officials who are disenchanted with the former president's behavior and policies. In a significant political maneuver, the vice president appeared alongside former congresswoman Liz Cheney to reinforce the message that voting for Harris is a safe choice for those opposed to Trump, particularly amid growing fears surrounding women's rights and legal repercussions among the voter base. Chris Wyant, a senior adviser for Harris's campaign in Michigan, acknowledges the strategy is heavily influenced by the hard lessons of the past election cycles. 'I just don't think there was the robust team and we didn't get the time from the candidate that we do now,' Wyant articulated. In direct opposition, Trump, along with his vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, has been actively promoting hard promises, even if many supporters harbor doubts about their feasibility. At a recent rally in Saginaw, Trump boldly proclaimed intentions to reclaim Michigan's identity as the 'car capital of the world ' even as the automotive landscape continues to decline, with over a dozen local factories shuttered in recent years. The former president has also tapped into regional tensions regarding electric vehicle policies during his rallies, knowing that a majority of voters in Michigan oppose government incentives for EVs, fearing potential job losses in traditional automotive manufacturing. Nonetheless, Trump faltered during a rally in Detroit when he derided a city still grappling with the aftermath of factory closures and ongoing population decline, saying, 'Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president.' Despite this, Trump maintains a significant advantage over Harris in voter trust concerning key issues like inflation and immigration. While the Biden administration boasts of a recovering economy highlighted by record job growth, many citizens in Michigan continue to struggle with the repercussions of rising living costs. At a soup kitchen in Saginaw, Darshell Roberson, a Black woman, expresses her concerns about economic stability over Trump's past rhetoric. 'I voted for Biden but I really feel like Biden has failed me. I trust Donald Trump,' she says, illustrating the complexities of voter sentiment. Roberson's shifting loyalties highlight the disenchantment prevalent among many Michiganders, particularly toward national Democrats perceived as overly aligned with corporate interests, turning away from the traditional values of supporting working individuals. Union leaders in Saginaw lament the rising trend of their membership supporting Trump, blaming it on the Democratic establishment's estrangement from its roots. Trump also attracts young white male voters in Michigan, including first-time voters who may influence his electoral prospects. Lewis Jensen, a young supporter, traveled to Saginaw for Trump's rally, stating, 'I'm voting for Trump. All my friends are voting for Trump. He may get a little crazy in some of the things he says but he'll put Americans first.' The fundamental challenge for Trump remains whether he can garner sufficient votes to secure victory should Democratic turnout for Harris mirror that of 2020. In conversations with fellow voters, Parker senses a shared anxiety about the potential return of Trump to power, a sentiment she believes will motivate turnout. 'He can do anything now if he gets re-elected. There's a lot of him that's just bluster and untruth, and he doesn't have the energy to follow through on half of it,' she warns. 'But he's now putting people around him that do. It could completely transform this country.' Parker further expresses a sense of foreboding regarding political freedoms, stating, 'I don't think we'll have the ability to protest. I don't think we'll have the ability to be heard. I'm not even sure if there will be elections again.' Parker, who was involved with the grassroots organization Voters Not Politicians , successfully campaigned for initiatives that ended gerrymandering and introduced early voting for the presidential election, empowering community efforts aimed at increasing turnout, particularly through initiatives like 'souls to polls' driven by Black churches. Students on campus are also mobilizing around issues like women's rights and international conflicts, with many rallying against the Biden administration's support for Israel amid the ongoing war in Gaza. Keaton Henning, a student at Saginaw Valley State University supporting Harris, reflects, 'I've been active since I heard what Donald Trump said about immigrants. But for a lot of students, it's women's rights. So restoring Roe v. Wade, that is a big thing that a lot of people on campus talk about.' The tensions surrounding the war in Gaza complicate Harris's campaign in Michigan, where numerous Arab American voters expressed their frustrations during the Democratic primaries, showing their reluctance to back candidates perceived to align with adverse policies toward their communities. As the election date approaches, Parker reflects on the anxiety hanging over her community, noting that this sentiment is leading many to consider drastic actions, including leaving the country altogether. 'One of my dearest friends is leaving the country on November 1. She's going to Canada to get out of the country and not coming back until it's all over,' Parker reveals, capturing the essence of the fear gripping the nation.",
"US Vice President Kamala Harris said on Sunday she was not concerned about talks between former President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and reiterated her positions on the conflict in the Middle East.

"Iran on Sunday called for an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting to condemn Israel's air strikes on the Islamic republic a day earlier. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi sent a letter to the UN chief and the head of the Council ""demanding an urgent meeting of the Security Council to take a decisive position in condemning this aggression"", a ministry statement said. On Saturday, Israel conducted air strikes on military sites in Iran in response to Tehran's October 1 attack on Israel, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander. In his letter, Araghchi said ""most of the projectiles fired were intercepted by Iran's defence systems"" but the attack led to damage at ""the target points"", as well as the death of four soldiers. He said the Israeli attack was a ""clear violation of the sovereignty"" of Iran which ""reserves the inherent right... to respond to this criminal aggression."" The Israeli military said it hit Iranian missile factories, missile installations and other systems in several regions, and warned Tehran against responding. Iran has downplayed the attack, saying it caused ""limited damage"" to a few radar systems, while media outlets dismissed the assault as ""weak"", signalling what analysts say is the Islamic republic's reluctance to escalate further.",

Israel announced the launch of ""precise strikes"" on military targets in Iran on October 26, in retaliation for attacks against it, as Iranian state media reported several explosions around the capital. (Photo by GPO / AFP) Photo license Purchase photo (AFP) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared on Sunday that Israel's ""precise and powerful"" strikes on Iran had been a success, as his country's forces pounded targets in Gaza and Lebanon. The previous day's strikes by Israeli planes on military targets in Iran had fed fears that the Middle East was spiralling towards an even wider conflict and triggered global calls for restraint. But Iranian leaders played down their importance, saying the strikes had caused only limited damage and killed four soldiers, while Netanyahu stressed that the raids had served their purpose of avenging an earlier Iranian missile barrage against Israel. ""The attack in Iran was precise and powerful, achieving all of its objectives,"" Netanyahu said, in a speech marking the official Hebrew calendar anniversary of the Hamas attack on October 7 last year. Israel's strikes were in retaliation for an October 1 attack by Iran, which fired about 200 missiles at Israel, though most were intercepted by the country's air defences. Netanyahu said: ""We kept our promise. The air force attacked Iran and hit Iran's defence capabilities and missile production."" His speech was interrupted by shouting from relatives of victims of the Hamas attack in the crowd. Netanyahu stood silently for more than a minute during the ceremony, which was broadcast live. There has been public and diplomatic pressure on the Israeli premier's administration to do more to strike a deal to secure the release of the remaining captives held in Gaza. - 'Painful concessions' - Israeli spy chief David Barnea is scheduled to head to Qatar on Sunday for talks aimed at restarting negotiations towards a hostage deal. Families of the hostages have called on the Israeli government to broker an agreement in the wake of the killing of Hamas' leader Yahya Sinwar earlier this month. Israeli and US officials as well as some analysts said Sinwar had been a key obstacle to a deal allowing for the freeing of up to 97 hostages still held by militants in Gaza. Earlier on Sunday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said ""painful concessions"" would be needed to secure their release and that military action alone would not achieve the country's war aims. Despite talk of negotiations, Israel continued to fight in Gaza and Lebanon. Dense smoke hung over the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut on Sunday after a night of bombardment in the southern suburbs, while there were reports of strikes in and around the southern cities of Sidon, Tyre and Nabatiyeh. Lebanon's health ministry said at least eight people were killed and 25 others wounded near Sidon. The war has left at least 1,615 people dead in Lebanon since September 23, according to an AFP tally based on official figures, though the real number is likely to be higher due to gaps in the data. The Israeli military said early on Sunday it had killed 70 Hezbollah fighters and struck 120 targets in southern Lebanon, while losing four of its own soldiers in ground fighting. It warned residents that they must evacuate more villages said to be housing Hezbollah sites. ""For your safety, you must evacuate your homes immediately and move to the north of the Awali River,"" military spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a social media post. The Awali is the northern border of Lebanon's southern governorate. - 'Gaza is unbearable' - Heavy bombing also continued in the densely populated Palestinian territory of Gaza. The Israeli military said it had killed another 40 militants in the territory, despite Gallant saying on Sunday that: ""In the south (Gaza), Hamas has ceased to act as a military structure."" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern for the fate of Gaza's civilians. ""The plight of Palestinian civilians trapped in north Gaza is unbearable,"" Guterres's spokesman said. Israel several weeks ago began an ongoing major operation in the north of Gaza, in particular around Jabalia and its neighbouring refugee camp. ""The Secretary-General is shocked by the harrowing levels of death, injury and destruction in the north, with civilians trapped under rubble, the sick and wounded going without life-saving health care and families lacking food and shelter."" At the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, Jihad Muqat mourned the death of his wife and two baby daughters whose bodies were pulled from under the rubble in Jabalia camp. ""My darling Lulu, she was three and a half years old and Sama was 12 days old,"" he said, adding that he'd already had to bury his two-year-old Lara earlier in the war. Israel launched the offensive in Gaza a year ago after Hamas's October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures. At least 42,924 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have been killed in the Israeli offensive on Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry, which the UN considers reliable. The war has since drawn in Iran-backed groups across the region, most notably Hezbollah in Lebanon, but also militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Iran's missile barrage and Israel's air strikes have raised concerns of a direct war but Tehran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took to social media to say that the attack ""should neither be exaggerated or minimised"". Earlier, the Iranian armed forces general staff said that while it was ""reserving its legal and legitimate right to respond at the appropriate moment, Iran is prioritising the establishment of a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon"". © Agence France-Presse",

"Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump, second right, greets local Muslim leaders during a campaign rally at the Suburban Collection Showplace, Saturday, Oct. 26, 2024 in Novi, Mich. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) In Michigan , a growing number of Muslim leaders are endorsing Donald Trump , a move many find surprising given his past rhetoric and policies targeting Muslim communities. This shift is largely driven by two key issues: disillusionment with the Biden administration 's foreign policy, especially regarding Gaza, and a perceived alignment between Trump's promises and the values held by conservative Muslims . Many Muslim voters in Michigan, particularly those of Arab and Palestinian descent, are deeply frustrated with Biden's strong support for Israel in the Gaza conflict . They feel the administration has neglected the Palestinian humanitarian crisis and find Trump's promises of peace in the Middle East appealing. Imam Belal Alzuhairi , speaking at a Trump rally, referred to the former president as the 'peace candidate,' emphasising Trump's commitment to ending U.S. involvement in 'endless wars.' This position has struck a chord with voters tired of prolonged conflicts affecting their ancestral homes. In addition to foreign policy concerns, Trump's conservative stance on social issues has resonated with many Michigan Muslims who feel their values are no longer reflected in Democratic policies. Mayor Amer Ghalib of Hamtramck, for example, has voiced opposition to progressive social policies like the inclusion of LGBTQ content in public schools and public displays of Pride symbols, which he sees as at odds with his community's values. For Ghalib and others, Trump's alignment with traditional family values and his promises to protect conservative beliefs provide a strong alternative to the Democrats' progressive agenda. by Taboola by Taboola Sponsored Links Sponsored Links Promoted Links Promoted Links You May Like IC Markets Operar CFDs de oro con uno de los diferenciales mas bajos? IC Markets Registrarse Undo Furthermore, Trump's previous diplomatic dealings with Muslim-majority nations, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, suggest to these voters that he is capable of fostering Middle Eastern stability, despite his past anti-Muslim rhetoric. Figures like Republican Congressman Darrell Issa, a Trump ally of Lebanese descent, have emphasised Trump's relationships with Middle Eastern leaders as evidence of his ability to broker peace, lending credibility to his anti-war promises. This blend of social conservatism, foreign policy alignment, and a strong anti-war message is reshaping Michigan's Muslim support, drawing them to Trump as a candidate who, in their view, better understands and advocates for their values and needs.",

"Egypt's president on Sunday said his country has proposed a two-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas during which four hostages held in Gaza would be freed and some Palestinian prisoners would be released. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, speaking in Cairo, said the proposal also includes the delivery of humanitarian aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. This is the first time Egypt's president has publicly proposed such a plan. Egypt, along with Qatar and the United States, has been a key mediator for peace talks between Israel and Hamas since the war broke out more than a year ago. Months of negotiations sputtered to a halt in August. El-Sissi said the proposal aims to ""move the situation forward,"" adding that once the two-day cease-fire goes into effect, negotiations would continue to make it permanent. There hasn't been a cease-fire in 11 months, since November's weeklong pause in fighting in which 105 hostages were released in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Egypt's proposal comes as Israel's top spy, Mossad chief David Barnea, is traveling to Doha on Sunday for talks with CIA Director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani. There have not been any immediate reactions from Israel or Hamas to Egypt's proposal. During a government memorial Sunday for the Hebrew anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that ""not every goal can be achieved through military operations."" He added that ""painful compromises will be required"" to return the hostages. Egypt's proposal came a day after Israeli strikes on Iran in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier this month. Iran's supreme leader said the attack ""should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,"" while stopping short of calling for retaliation. It was Israel's first open attack on its archenemy. That exchange of fire has raised fears of an all-out regional war pitting Israel and the United States against Iran and its militant proxies, which include Hamas and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, where Israel launched a ground invasion earlier this month after nearly a year of lower-level conflict sparked by the war in Gaza.",
"As CIA Director William Burns is set to renew hostage talks in Doha on Sunday, families of the Tikva (Hope) Forum have demanded an urgent meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying, ""The State of Israel is endangering the hostages by negotiating with Hamas."" The Tikva Forum, which represents some families of hostages, sent a letter to Netanyahu demanding an immediate meeting to explain the 'great danger in conducting negotiations with Hamas.' 'Our very treatment of Hamas as an organization sends Gaza residents the message that Hamas still controls the [Gaza] Strip,' the letter read. 'The very thought of a deal that doesn't include all hostages inherently endangers our loved ones,' the forum added. Dealings with Hamas area creating a lifeline for Hamas by treating it as an organization, just at the moment that the organization is ""closer to breaking than ever,"" said the forum. ""There is no logic to negotiation with Hamas, said the forum, adding that 'the hostages don't have time, and we must take a new path to preserve their lives.' Setting the record straight The forum demanded that the state create a policy that makes it clear to residents of Gaza that Hamas no longer exists as an organization and asked that the government increase pressure to get to those who are holding hostages and negotiate with them. The resistance of the Tikva forum to a deal and to negotiation with Hamas is at odds with the opinions of many hostage families and with the stance of the Hostage Family Forum, which represents many of the families of hostages. Many families have vocally called for a hostage deal and negotiations with Hamas, saying it is the only way to bring their loved ones home and pointing to the fact that many more hostages have been brought back through negotiations than through military rescues.",
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu takes part in a ceremony at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem on Sunday marking the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza.

Meanwhile, Israeli strikes on northern Gaza killed at least 33 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Sunday, as Israel's offensive in the hard-hit and isolated area entered a third week and the U.N. secretary-general called the plight of Palestinians there 'unbearable.' Israel said it targeted militants. Two Israeli strikes killed eight people in Sidon city in southern Lebanon, with 25 wounded, according to Lebanon's health ministry. One strike hit a residential building, according to footage taken by an Associated Press reporter. The Israeli military said four soldiers, including a military rabbi, were killed in fighting in southern Lebanon, without providing details. It said five other personnel were severely wounded. An explosive drone and a projectile fired from Lebanon wounded five people in Israel, authorities said. NETANYAHU: STRIKES ON IRAN ACHIEVED ISRAEL'S GOALS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his first public comments on the strikes said 'we severely harmed Iran's defense capabilities and its ability to produce missiles that are aimed toward us.' Satellite images showed damage to two secretive Iranian military bases – one linked to work on nuclear weapons that Western intelligence agencies and nuclear inspectors say was discontinued in 2003, and another linked to Iran's ballistic missile program. Iran on Sunday said a civilian had been killed, with no details. It earlier said four people with the military air defense were killed. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's 85-year-old supreme leader, said 'it is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime.' Khamenei would make any final decision on how Iran responds. Later Sunday, protesters disrupted a speech by Netanyahu at a nationally broadcast ceremony for victims of Hamas' attack on southern Israel last year that sparked the war in Gaza. People shouted 'Shame on you' and forced Netanyahu to stop his speech. Many Israelis blame Netanyahu for the failures that led to the' attack and hold him responsible for not yet bringing home remaining hostages. TRUCK RAMMING IN ISRAEL WOUNDS DOZENS In a separate development, a truck rammed into a bus stop near Tel Aviv, killing one person and wounding more than 30. Israeli police said the attacker was an Arab citizen of Israel. The ramming occurred outside a military base and near the headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency. The truck slammed into a bus in Ramat Hasharon as Israelis were returning to work after a holiday, leaving some people stuck under vehicles. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said six of the wounded were in serious condition. The Ichilov Medical Center reported that one person had died. Asi Aharoni, a police spokesperson, told reporters the attacker had been 'neutralized,' without saying if the assailant was dead. Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group praised the attack but did not claim it. Palestinians have carried out scores of stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks over the years. Tensions have soared since the war in Gaza began. Israel has carried out regular military raids into the occupied West Bank that have left hundreds dead. Most appear to have been militants killed during shootouts with Israeli forces, but Palestinians taking part in violent protests and civilian bystanders have also been killed. 'HORRIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES' IN NORTHERN GAZA The Gaza Health Ministry's emergency service said 11 women and two children were among the 22 killed in strikes late Saturday on several homes and buildings in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. It said another 15 were wounded. The Israeli military said it carried out a strike on militants. A Health Ministry official, Hussein Mohesin, said 11 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in the Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza. The Israeli army did not immediately comment. Israel has struck a number of such shelters, often killing women and children, saying it targets militants hiding among civilians. Israel has waged a massive air and ground offensive in northern Gaza since early October, saying Hamas militants have regrouped there. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Gaza City in the latest wave of displacement. Aid groups have warned of a catastrophic situation in northern Gaza, which has suffered the heaviest destruction of the war. Israel has severely limited the entry of basic humanitarian aid in recent weeks, and the three remaining hospitals in the north – one raided over the weekend – say they have been overwhelmed by waves of wounded. The U.N. secretary-general in a statement by his spokesperson noted 'harrowing levels of death.' The International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday described the civilian population in 'horrific circumstances.' The war began when Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's border wall and stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The offensive has devastated much of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people have crowded into squalid tent camps, and aid groups say hunger is rampant. Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel; Magdy from Cairo; and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

"The people affected by the Wayanad landslides will be rehabilitated with or without Central assistance, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. He was inaugurating the valedictory function of the week-long observance of the 78th anniversary of the Punnapra-Vayalar uprising at Vayalar in Alappuzha on Sunday. 'The Wayanad tragedy was one of the biggest disasters the country has witnessed. Following the landslides, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Wayanad and promised a special package. Later, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had promised aid. Though a team visited the affected areas and submitted a report to the Union government, the State has not yet received its due share from the Centre. We have taken up the matter with the Centre multiple times, but there has been no response. We will rehabilitate all the affected people, with or without Central aid,' Mr. Vijayan said. He noted that other States that experienced calamities after the Wayanad tragedy had already received assistance from the Centre. Dig at Congress Criticising the Congress for its soft stance against communal forces and its 'tacit understanding' with several of them, Mr. Vijayan reiterated that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government would continue to act tough against communalism. He said the Congress had often sided with communal forces for short-term gains. The Chief Minister said that Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president K. Sudhakaran had admitted to sending Congress workers to protect Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) offices. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan had attended RSS ideologue M.S. Golwalkar's remembrance meeting, Mr. Vijayan said The Chief Minister said that in the 2016 Assembly polls, the BJP candidate won the Nemom seat after receiving Congress votes. 'When it comes to the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, BJP won the Thrissur seat. Congress's vote count there decreased by 87,000 compared to previous elections, while the LDF candidate's vote count increased by 16,000 compared to 2019, though we lost. It is obvious how the BJP secured victory in Thrissur. The communist parties will not ally with communal forces for political gains,' he said, adding that both Jamaat-e-Islami and Social Democratic Party of India are supporting the Congress-led United Democratic Front. Lashing out at the BJP government at the Centre for its stance in the ongoing West Asia conflict, the Chief Minister said it was supporting Israel, not Palestine, to appease US imperialism. Mr. Vijayan said the RSS and other Sangh Parivar organisations had no role in the freedom movement. 'The Union government is trying to rewrite history to fit its agenda, starting with school textbooks. It does not recognise the Punnapra-Vayalar uprising as part of the Independence movement,' he said. Former Minister and CPI(M) leader T.M. Thomas Isaac, Agriculture Minister P.

"Iran Press/Iran news: In the wake of the Israeli regime's missile attack on Iran, FM Abbas Araghchi wrote a letter to the UN Secretary-General and the head of the UN Security Council, calling for an urgent meeting of the UNSC to condemn the aggression. The Israeli regime tried to hit some targets within the Iranian national in western Tehran, the capital, and Khuzestan and Ilam Provinces in Western Iran, On Saturday early morning, October 26. The Israeli missiles were intercepted, yet they caused little damage. Araghchi said in the letter that although the Israeli projectiles were intercepted by the Iranian defense system, the aggression led to damages to the targeted points and the martyrdom of 4 Iranian soldiers. Based on the principles endorsed in the UN Charter and within the framework of international law, the Islamic Republic of Iran considered the rights preserved for itself to respond the Israeli crime. It is more than one year, since October 7, 2023, that the Israeli regime, backed by the US, has launched an all-out war in the region and is massacring the people of Gaza, West Bank, and Lebanon while assaulting other countries like Iran and Syria. The regime's attack on Gaza and Lebanon since the day has left more than 45,000 Palestinians and Lebanese martyred and more than 100,000 others wounded. 215",
"QUSAIR, Syria — (AP) — A stream of refugees fleeing Lebanon to Syria crossed a narrow makeshift bridge on foot Sunday in the Qusair area of Syria's Homs province after the official border crossing was put out of commission by an Israeli strike two days earlier. Only three functioning crossings remain between the countries, which share a border 375 kilometers (233 mi) long. In late September, an Israeli airstrike hit the border crossing of Matraba in Lebanon's northeast, forcing it to close. A few weeks later came a strike on Masnaa, the main crossing between the two countries, putting it out of service. The Jousieh crossing was struck on Friday. The Israeli military has accused the Hezbollah militant group of using the crossings to move weapons and military equipment from Syria to Lebanon. But humanitarian officials say that the closure of the crossings have intensified an already severe humanitarian crisis by blocking key routes for supplies and impeding access for those fleeing to safety. 'The situation is a tragedy,' said Ghossoun Mubarak, who fled with her three children from the city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, describing the bombardment that pushed her to leave her home. They crossed via the makeshift foot bridge on Sunday. The United Nations refugee agency, or UNHCR, said this week that around 430,000 people had crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the past month since Israel launched a major aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Lebanon as part of its push against Hezbollah. Lebanese officials give a higher estimate of more than half a million people. Rula Amin, a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, voiced concern over the damage to the crossings, calling them 'a main lifeline for people escaping the conflict.' 'Today, it was better,' said Omar Abu Jabal, 29, who was returning to Lebanon Sunday via the Jousieh crossing after a work trip. 'No issues along the way. But before, there were bombings, which stopped people from moving.' Nabil Aakoul, director of transportation for the Homs province, said the recent strikes destroyed a bridge over the Orontes River, disrupting movement between vital agricultural areas. Aakoul estimated that rebuilding the bridge will cost around 35 billion Syrian pounds (around $2.5 million dollars at the official exchange rate), while the damage has severed access to agricultural areas and isolated communities dependent on cross-river trade and travel. Yahya Abu Youssef, who lives near the damaged bridge, described the strike as 'inhumane' and reported injuries to children and livestock nearby. 'All that's here is a bridge connecting villages and farms,' he said, noting that villagers now face an additional 10 kilometers (6 miles) of travel to reach the city of Homs.

"A memo circulating among at least half a dozen advisers to former President Donald J. Trump recommends that if he is elected, he bypass traditional background checks by law enforcement officials and immediately grant security clearances to a large number of his appointees after being sworn in, according to three people briefed on the matter. The proposal is being promoted by a small group including Boris Epshteyn, a top legal adviser to Mr. Trump who was influential in its development, according to the three people. It is not clear whether Mr. Trump has seen the proposal or whether he is inclined to adopt it if he takes office. But it would allow him to quickly install loyalists in major positions without subjecting them to the risk of long-running and intrusive F.B.I. background checks, potentially increasing the risks of people with problematic histories or ties to other nations being given influential White House roles. Such checks hung up clearances for a number of aides during Mr. Trump's presidency, including Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Mr. Epshteyn himself. The proposal suggests using private-sector investigators and researchers to perform background checks on Mr. Trump's intended appointees during the transition, cutting out the role Asked about the proposal, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, responded with an attack on Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she and Democrats 'have weaponized the Department of Justice to attack President Trump and his supporters' and that Mr. Trump would use 'the full powers of the presidency' to build his administration starting on Inauguration Day. A number of Mr. Trump's advisers — and the former president himself — have long viewed background checks for security clearances with deep suspicion. They believe that the process is designed to make challenges to outcomes difficult, and that personal pieces of information submitted during the vetting can be disseminated later for damaging results. Mr. Trump has long railed about the F.B.I. being part of a 'deep state' conspiracy to undermine him. It is not clear what positions the altered system would cover, but the people familiar with the proposal said it appeared to apply to a large number of potential Trump appointees in a second administration. Mr. Epshteyn, who was It is not clear whether Mr. Epshteyn would like to go into government, but his name is on at least one list compiled outside the official transition process as a possible White House counsel, or a top lawyer overseeing them, according to two people briefed on the matter. That list was prepared with Mr. Epshteyn's input, according to a third person briefed on the matter. Traditional federal background investigations for security clearances carry risks for potential appointees. Lying on official application materials could lead to Security clearances have been a critical part of the government's system for protecting national security secrets, which dates back to World War II and the early Cold War. Background investigations for clearances are intended to turn up hidden foreign conflicts or personal problems that could reveal that applicants are a security risk because they could be susceptible to blackmail by foreign spies or are otherwise untrustworthy. The process is grounded in executive orders and memorandums — not federal statutes enacted by Congress — and Under Many agencies investigate their own nominees, and sometimes basic vetting, including for employees of contractors, has been outsourced to private firms which then provide dossiers to the sponsoring agencies. But under Starting with information provided by applicants in their clearance application forms, agents check law enforcement databases and interview people who know them in search of red flags. They look at any criminal conduct; psychological conditions and personal behavior; alcohol or substance abuse; foreign contacts; personal finances and similar matters. If initial checks uncover no problems, people can be granted interim clearances to begin working with classified information while the investigation continues, though they can face greater restrictions on access to more sensitive data — especially more restricted forms of top secret information — until they receive permanent clearances. Across the government, the findings of background checks are shared with the sponsoring agency, which makes the final decision. And when a background check uncovers evidence of a potential crime, it can lead to a criminal referral for further investigation. But presidents subjecting their appointees to the FB.I. vetting process is a norm, not a legal requirement. As a matter of constitutional law, there is nothing to stop a president from cutting out the F.B.I. and granting a clearance to access classified information to anyone, based on his or her own discretion. Like many other aspects of Mr. Trump's first term and plans for a second term, the proposed move to do so for his appointees would exploit the gap between legal limits and traditional norms of presidential self-restraint. A number of Mr. Trump's appointees faced delays and roadblocks in getting clearances in his administration. In addition to Mr. Epshteyn, who failed to get a clearance during a brief White House stint in 2017 before leaving the post, many aides worked with temporary security clearances for more than a year because they could not get permanent clearances approved. Others eventually left the government, too. (The Trump campaign said earlier this year that Mr. Epshteyn's clearance issue, which was never clarified, was 'resolved,' but provided no further details). Mr. Kushner, who played a variety of roles including as an envoy to the Middle East brokering deals to get Arab states to recognize Israel, went through months of questions over his background check for reasons that were never publicly disclosed. Finally, in 2018, Mr. Trump overrode the normal process and In 2019, a manager in the White House's Personnel Security Office told a House committee Mr. Kushner's allies have claimed that the process was an attempt to damage Mr. Trump by extension. There are other aides who have been investigated along with Mr. Trump over the past four years who might struggle under the current process if Mr. Trump wants to bring them into the government. Among them are Walt Nauta, Mr. Trump's personal aide, who was his co-defendant in the since-dismissed classified documents case, and Peter Navarro, who was Mr. Trump's trade adviser and Another former White House adviser who is close to Mr. Trump, Stephen K. Bannon, is set to be released from prison in the coming days. He was Mr. Kushner has said he does not plan to return to government. But if he changes his mind, the career officials handling security clearances inside the U.S. intelligence community under the current system would have to contend with the implications of the nearly $3 billion he raised for Other supporters of Mr. Trump have proposed overhauling the system for vetting security clearances. One came from the Project 2025 ' The project proposed that the White House's National Security Council — run by the president's national security adviser — should be authorized to adjudicate internally whether its own staff receive security clearances, with investigators who 'work directly for the N.S.C. and whose sole task is to clear N.S.C. officials.' (The Trump campaign has disavowed Project 2025, and a top Trump transition official said that its authors would not be involved in any transition.) In December, the Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump think tank run by Mr. Trump's former head of the Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, published a The paper said that it must be made 'crystal clear that agency heads may grant, suspend or revoke security clearances — notwithstanding the recommendations of subordinates.'

"At the start of Sunday's State Memorial Ceremony for the Fallen of Operation Iron Swords at Mount Herzl, the public knew of 898 soldiers, police officers, and members of the security services who had fallen since October 7. By the end of the ceremony, that number stood at 902, as the names of four more soldiers who fell—this time in a battle in southern Lebanon on Saturday—were permitted for publication while the ceremony was underway. Later in the day, two more names were added. This chilling convergence of events was an embodiment of the kind of year Israel has experienced: during a memorial service, more names were added to those being mourned. To a certain extent, the period since October 7 has felt like one long Remembrance Day. The names of the fallen are read on the radio, heart-wrenching stories fill television and radio broadcasts, and newspapers feature interviews with friends and families recounting snippets of the fallen's lives. Over a year later, this extended Remembrance Day-like feeling shows no sign of letting up. The two state memorial ceremonies held on Sunday as part of the government-declared national day of mourning for the events of October 7 —one for fallen soldiers, police, and security service personnel, and the other for civilians killed—gave the day a Remembrance Day feel. But the entire year since October 7 has carried that heavy and sorrowful tone. Or, as President Isaac Herzog said at the beginning of his speech at the ceremony for the soldiers: 'It has already been a full year that our lives have been shrouded in unceasing and heavy mourning for our sons and daughters who fell in battle.' Even before uttering those words, he said, 'At this moment, our hearts are with the dozens wounded and affected in the severe terror attack near the Glilot base.' This is Israel, October 2024: More fallen soldiers, a memorial ceremony, a terror attack. Headlines never stop breaking in Israel As the ceremony was broadcast on Channel 12, the news ticker at the bottom of the screen read: 'A ramming attack in Glilot: 37 wounded, 6 in serious condition, the truck driver neutralized.' But this is also Israel, October 2024: One hundred and forty IAF aircraft flying nearly 2,000 kilometers in jaw-dropping precision over enemy territory to knock out some of the world's best air defense systems, the Russian-made S-300s, and a factory making key components for Iran's ballistic missiles. Also, IDF soldiers blowing up a massive underground tunnel—in fact, an underground military base for Hezbollah that was to serve as a jumping-off point for terrorists to invade northern Israel in an October 7-style attack—using enough explosives to make the earth shake and trigger earthquake sensors. The country is at war, and the national mood swings from euphoria—the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the attacks in Iran, the discovery and destruction of the Hezbollah tunnels—to depression: hearing about additional fatalities, or another terrorist attack. 'A year ago,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the state ceremony, 'we suffered an unbearable blow, but we were not broken. Immense pain struck us, but we did not collapse. We fought back against our attackers, as we have done that until today.' That pretty much sums up the mood: pain, but resilience and determination. It is horrifyingly difficult—as the two memorial ceremonies interspersed with news of another terror attack and more fallen soldiers made so clear on Sunday—but if the Jewish people want a state here, history has provided no alternative path. Netanyahu quoted words a senior Egoz commander gave his unit before they moved into southern Lebanon earlier this month: 'We have a great privilege to write history. As we did in Gaza, we'll do so here in the north.' Indeed, history is being written. Decades from now, people will read about this war—the sacrifices and the achievements—and admire the grit, determination, and will of those who fought it, and the civilians who endured it, with the same admiration we today have for those who fought in and survived the War of Independence, the Six-Day War, and the Yom Kippur War. Their admiration will be well deserved. However, the emotional rollercoaster of the last two two months -- beginning with the exploding beepers in Lebanon and running through the killing of Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah, Sinwar, Iranian ballistic missile attacks, drone attacks on a Golani base, and the unceasing reports of fallen soldiers and terror attacks — has been a heavy burden for all. Adding to the difficulty are the personal war-related worries so many people face, alongside the general national concerns. These include anxieties about the well-being of loved ones in the army and reserves in Gaza and in southern Lebanon, as well as concerns about how their spouses and children are managing at home without them. This combination makes the entire experience far from easy. Necessary? Yes. Meaningful? Yes. The stuff of which Jewish history is made? Definitely. But trying, taxing and—as was so clearly evident on Sunday—profoundly difficult.",
"Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has given a measured response to Israeli strikes on the country, saying the attack should not be 'exaggerated or downplayed' while refraining from pledging immediate retaliation. President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would 'give an appropriate response' to the attack, which killed at least four soldiers, adding that Tehran did not seek war. Israel said it targeted military sites in several regions of Iran on Saturday in retaliation for Iranian attacks, including a barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October. On Sunday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had crippled Iranian air defence and missile production systems. He said the strikes had 'severely damaged Iran's defence capability and its ability to produce missiles'. 'The attack was precise and powerful and achieved its goals,' Netanyahu said at a ceremony commemorating the victims of last year's 7 October attacks. 'This regime must understand a simple principle: whoever hurts us, we hurt him.' Official Iranian sources have publicly played down the impact of the attack, saying most missiles were intercepted and those that weren't caused only limited damage to air defence systems. In his first public comments since the attack, Khamenei said: 'It is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country.' President Pezeshkian largely echoed the supreme leader's language, telling a cabinet meeting: 'We do not seek war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country.' The Israeli strikes were more limited than some observers had been expecting. The US had publicly pressured Israel not to hit oil and nuclear facilities, advice seemingly heeded by Tel Aviv. Western countries have urged Iran in turn not to respond in order to break the cycle of escalation between both Middle Eastern countries, which they fear could lead to all-out regional war. Iranian media has carried footage of daily life continuing as normal and framing the 'limited' damage as a victory, a choice analysts said was intended to reassure Iranians. Fighting continued between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas in Gaza. On Sunday, an Israeli air strike on the town of Sidon in southern Lebanon killed at least eight people, according to local authorities. In Gaza, nine people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in the al-Shati refugee camp, Palestinians officials said. Palestinian media and the Reuters news agency said three of the dead were Palestinian journalists, citing government officials. And in Israel, a man was killed and at least 30 injured after a truck hit a bus stop near an Israeli military base north of Tel Aviv, in what authorities said was a suspected terror attack. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday proposed a two-day ceasefire in Gaza, which would involve an exchange of four Israeli hostages for some Palestinian prisoners. He said that within 10 days of implementing such a temporary ceasefire, talks should resume with the aim of reaching a more permanent one. But speaking to the BBC's Arabic Service, a senior Hamas official said its conditions for a ceasefire – rejected by Israel for months – have not changed. Sami Abu Zuhri said the Palestinian militant group continued to demand a complete ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a serious prisoner swap deal. 'Any agreement that does not guarantee these conditions holds no value,' he added.",
"Israel is under massive international pressure not to approve legislation Monday that would shut down the United Nations Relief and Works Agency operations servicing Palestinian refugees in east Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Bank. Foreign Ministers from Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement expressing their 'grave concern' over the shutdown, particularly in light of the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza due to the war. 'It is crucial that UNRWA and other UN organizations and agencies be fully able to deliver humanitarian aid and their assistance to those who need it most, fulfilling their mandates effectively,' they said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Israeli officials last week about the importance of ensuring that UNRWA, which has serviced Palestinian refugees in east Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Bank since 1949, remains operational. The Biden administration mentioned the importance of maintaining UNRWA operations in a letter it wrote Israel in October, threatening to restrict military assistance to the IDF as dictated under Memorandum 20 unless Israel took steps to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. US Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew is among a group of envoys, including from Germany, Italy, Australia, and Great Britain, who have also been holding conversations with Israeli politicians urging them to maintain UNRWA services. Israel fears that the international community could seek retribution by taking steps against it at the United Nations. Among the possible political action at the UN could be a push to strip the Jewish state of voting rights at the General Assembly, or the credentials of the Israeli mission to the UN could be stripped. UNRWA services 5.9 million refugees in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, the West Bank, Gaza, and east Jerusalem. The UN General Assembly approves its mandate to operate annually, and only the UNGA has the power to close the organization. Israel, however, has the power to prevent UNRWA from operating in territory under its sovereign or military control. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Right-wing politicians have long called for the UN to close UNRWA, but they have not seized control of the situation locally by using the government and legislative power they have to close the agency, which is seen as the primary organization providing humanitarian services to Palestinians. Israel had long argued that the organization incited against Israel and Jews and helped ensure that there would be a permanent and ever-expanding group of Palestinian refugees. The IDF, however, had held that UNRWA's provision of humanitarian services provided an important element of stabilization in the region. In the last year, since the Hamas-led invasion of Israel on October 7 and the IDF's subsequent military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, Israel, and the IDF have come to believe that UNRWA is so intertwined with Hamas that it can not be a neutral service provider. Worse, it had charged that a number of UNRWA employees were involved in the seizure of captives on October 7 and that the organization employed Hamas terrorists. Some six lawmakers had put forward legation to close UNRWA, which have now been reduced to two private member bills, which were approved by the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, whose chairman MK Yuli Edelstein (Likud) has explained that these bills are now considered committee legislation. The bill, which he said, has broad support from the opposition and the coalition, is now set for its final second and third readings. Edelstein told The Jerusalem Post that the first bill relates just to Jerusalem, and the second broad one cancels the invitation to UNRWA to operate in an area under Israeli control and bars Israeli officials from engaging with it. There is an irreparable difference of opinion between Israel and the international community, Edelstein said, adding that 'This is a gap we can't bridge.' The international community believes that UNRWA is 'irreplaceable' as a service provider and part of a 'solution' for Palestinians, he said. 'Our approach is that we have to legislate something that will effectively stop UNRWA activities in our area because they are part of the problem,' he said. Turning a blind eye Prior to October 7, everyone turned 'a blind eye' to the problem, he said. It's 'absurd' that a year has passed since the October 7 attack and the government has not yet taken any action against UNRWA. It's asking every other country to stop UNRWA's operations but has not taken any steps available to it to shut UNRWA down. 'There is no doubt,' he charged, 'that UNRWA is part of the Hamas rule in Gaza. It's part of raising another generation of terrorists in Gaza and Judea and Samaria and we have to put an end to it.' He noted that there is now wide consensus against UNRWA both in the opposition and the coalition, estimating that some 100 lawmakers are likely to support the two bills. He noted that once the bills pass, there would be a three-month period before UNRWA would have to cease its operations. This would allow time for another alternative to be found to provide services to Palestinians. A US Embassy spokesperson, however, hinted that Israel could be responsible for filling that gap. 'Pending legislation would make it impossible for UNRWA to operate and would leave a vacuum that Israel would then be responsible for filling. Adding to the humanitarian crisis that already exists would undermine stability and security for Israel and the region,' the spokesperson told The Jerusalem Post. The 'involvement of UNRWA personnel on Oct 7 was reprehensible, and led the US to halt funding,' the spokesperson said. 'We have called for those involved to be held accountable and for UNRWA reforms to address serious concerns about its facilities and personnel being involved in terrorist activities,' the spokesperson said. 'At the same time, UNRWA provides vital services in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, and Jordan - including humanitarian assistance, health benefits care and sanitation,' the spokesperson explained. UNRWA called the pending Knesset vote ""outrageous. 'Such a move by a UN member state against a UN General Assembly-mandated organization is unprecedented and dangerous. It opposes the UN Charter and violates the State of Israel's obligations under international law,' a UNRWA spokesperson said. 'This is a step against the multilateral system. It is the latest step in the ongoing, systematic campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role towards providing human-development assistance and services to Palestine Refugees,' the spokesperson stressed. Such a step would interrupt the provision of important humanitarian assistance to two million people in Gaza in the West Bank, 'with severe impact on the lives of people,' the spokesperson said 'Without UNRWA, the delivery of food, shelter, and health care to most of Gaza's population would grind to a halt,' the spokesperson stressed. Social services for Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem would collapse, the UNRWA spokesperson added. 'This legislation would set a grave precedent for other conflict situations where governments may wish to eliminate an inconvenient United Nations presence' and would compromise humanitarian work worldwide, the spokesperson said.",

"Share this @internewscast.com QUSAIR – A stream of refugees fleeing Lebanon to Syria crossed a narrow makeshift bridge on foot Sunday in the Qusair area of Syria's Homs province after the official border crossing was put out of commission by an Israeli strike two days earlier. Only three functioning crossings remain between the countries, which share a border 375 kilometers (233 mi) long. In late September, an Israeli airstrike hit the border crossing of Matraba in Lebanon's northeast, forcing it to close. A few weeks later came a strike on Masnaa, the main crossing between the two countries, putting it out of service. The Jousieh crossing was struck on Friday. The Israeli military has accused the Hezbollah militant group of using the crossings to move weapons and military equipment from Syria to Lebanon. But humanitarian officials say that the closure of the crossings have intensified an already severe humanitarian crisis by blocking key routes for supplies and impeding access for those fleeing to safety. 'The situation is a tragedy,' said Ghossoun Mubarak, who fled with her three children from the city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, describing the bombardment that pushed her to leave her home. They crossed via the makeshift foot bridge on Sunday. The United Nations refugee agency, or UNHCR, said this week that around 430,000 people had crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the past month since Israel launched a major aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Lebanon as part of its push against Hezbollah. Lebanese officials give a higher estimate of more than half a million people. Rula Amin, a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, voiced concern over the damage to the crossings, calling them 'a main lifeline for people escaping the conflict.' 'Today, it was better,' said Omar Abu Jabal, 29, who was returning to Lebanon Sunday via the Jousieh crossing after a work trip. 'No issues along the way. But before, there were bombings, which stopped people from moving.' Nabil Aakoul, director of transportation for the Homs province, said the recent strikes destroyed a bridge over the Orontes River, disrupting movement between vital agricultural areas. Aakoul estimated that rebuilding the bridge will cost around 35 billion Syrian pounds (around $2.5 million dollars at the official exchange rate), while the damage has severed access to agricultural areas and isolated communities dependent on cross-river trade and travel. Yahya Abu Youssef, who lives near the damaged bridge, described the strike as 'inhumane' and reported injuries to children and livestock nearby. 'All that's here is a bridge connecting villages and farms,' he said, noting that villagers now face an additional 10 kilometers (6 miles) of travel to reach the city of Homs.

At least 29 people were injured, including six who were in serious condition, emergency service providers Magen David Adom said in a separate statement. Police did not clarify whether it was an attack, but added that civilians at the site ""shot the truck driver and neutralised him"". Paramedic Elior Yosef, who arrived at the bus stop after the ramming, said he saw eight people ""trapped under the truck"". ""A number of further casualties were either lying or walking near the truck,"" he was quoted as saying in the statement issued by Magen David Adom. Officers and ambulances rushed to the scene, where AFP journalists saw police cordoning off the area as medics helped the injured and a helicopter hovered above. Palestinian militant group Hamas, in a statement, said the ""heroic ramming attack"" that was carried out near ""Mossad headquarters... was in response to the crimes committed by the Zionist occupation"" against Palestinians. In a separate incident, a man who tried to stab a group of soldiers was killed in the area of Hizma near Jerusalem. ""A terrorist accelerated with his vehicle toward IDF soldiers who were conducting counterterrorism activity adjacent to the area of Hizma,"" the military said in a statement, without identifying the attacker. ""The terrorist pulled out a knife from his vehicle, and attempted to carry out a stabbing attack. The soldiers eliminated the terrorist and thwarted the attempted terror attack,"" it said, adding that no soldiers were injured. Since the war in Gaza broke out on October 7 last year, there have been several attacks in Israel carried out by Palestinian militants. At least 30 people, including Israeli soldiers, have been killed in such attacks since then in Israel, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Sunday's incidents come as Israel held ceremonies to mark the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack that sparked the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon. (AFP)",
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Voters in this year's presidential election are choosing between two conflicting visions of the United States offered by Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. The outcome will affect how the country sees itself and how it's viewed across the world, with repercussions that could echo for decades. Since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Harris has pledged to blaze her own path forward. But many of the vice president's ideas are well trod by Biden: middle-class tax cuts, tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, a restoration of abortion rights, a government that aggressively addresses climate change. and a commitment to uphold democratic values and the rule of law. Trump has pledged retaliation against rivals as he pushes to fulfill an agenda sidetracked during his previous term by the global pandemic. The former president wants to undertake a mass deportation of migrants who are living in the United States illegally, extend and expand his 2017 tax cuts, greatly increase tariffs and offer more support for fossil fuels and less support for renewable energy. He has attacked transgender rights and pledged to end Russia's war with Ukraine while suggesting Ukraine must make territorial concessions. He also is seeking to concentrate more government power within the White House. The candidates have spelled out their ideas in speeches, advertisements and other venues. Both say that their approach would do more to lift up workers, the middle class and the promises that have defined America. While Trump and Harris agree on not taxing workers' tips, the similarities largely stop there — a further sign of how the election's outcome could reshape the country. A look at where each candidate stands on 10 top issues: HARRIS: She has called on Congress to pass legislation guaranteeing abortion access in federal law, a right that stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022. She has campaigned on how the patchwork of state laws limiting abortion have hurt women's access to medical care, in one prominent case leading to the death in Georgia of Amber Nicole Thurman. Harris has promoted the administration's efforts short of federal law, including steps to protect women who travel to access the procedure and limit how law enforcement collects medical records. Her argument to the public is rooted in the concept of freedom, saying 'the freedom to make decisions about one's own body should not be made by the government.' TRUMP: He often brags about nominating the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believed abortion should be restricted, Trump announced last spring that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He has praised the patchwork of restrictions that have emerged across Republican-led states, saying the people are deciding. He has said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law and would not try to block access to abortion medication, after initially waffling. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies, but he has not rejected the idea outright. He has said that, if he wins, he wants to make in vitro fertilization treatment free for women. He has even claimed that he is the 'father' of the treatment, first used in 1978, even though it has only come under threat because of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. HARRIS: She has done something of an about-face, saying in her campaign that it's possible to continue hydraulic fracturing for fossil fuels even as she embraces policies that favor renewable energy resources. Republicans are quick to point out that Harris opposed offshore drilling and fracking during her short-lived campaign for the 2020 presidential nomination. As a senator from California, Harris was an early sponsor of the Green New Deal, a sweeping series of proposals meant to swiftly move the U.S. to fully green energy. It was a plan championed by the Democratic Party's most progressive wing. But during her tenure as vice president, Harris has adopted more moderate positions, focusing on implementing the climate provisions of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. That provided nearly $375 billion for things such as financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects. The Biden administration has also enlisted more than 20,000 young people in a national Climate Corps, a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through projects such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Despite that, it's unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to meet Biden's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. TRUMP: His mantra for one of his top policy priorities: 'DRILL, BABY, DRILL.' Trump, who in the past said climate change was a 'hoax' and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it's his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world. He has claimed he will cut prices in half within a year of his potential return to office. While he often criticizes the Biden administration for its policies, domestic oil production has already been at near-record highs since late 2023, according to the Energy Information Administration. Trump wants to push that higher by increasing oil drilling on public lands, offering tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speeding the approval of natural gas pipelines, opening dozens of new power plants, including nuclear facilities, and rolling back the Biden administration's aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn't be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris climate agreement, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads. HARRIS: Like Biden, Harris has decried Trump as a threat to the nation's democracy. She has agreed with former Trump administration officials who labeled him a 'fascist.' Harris has leaned more heavily into her personal background as a prosecutor and contrasted that with Trump being found guilty of 34 felony counts in a New York hush money case and being found liable for fraudulent business practices and sexual abuse in civil court. Harris initially talked less frequently than Biden did about Trump's denial of his 2020 loss and his incitement of the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. But in the closing weeks of the 2024 campaign, she increasingly has framed the prospect of another Trump term as 'dangerous.' TRUMP: After refusing to accept that Biden won, Trump hasn't committed to accepting the 2024 results. He's repeatedly promised to pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol, and recently threatened to jail lawyers, election officials, donors and others 'involved in unscrupulous behavior' surrounding November's vote. He has lashed out at media organizations, threatening their broadcast licenses in response to debate questions and coverage he's deemed unfair. Trump has called his Democratic rivals the 'enemy within' who are 'more dangerous than China, Russia and all these countries.' He pledges to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI 'from the ground up,' aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime and in response to protests, and has also pledged to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden. Federal government HARRIS: Like Biden, Harris has campaigned hard against 'Project 2025″ — a plan that Trump has denounced but that was written by leading conservatives and many of his former administration officials. The plan lays out how to move as swiftly as possible to dramatically remake the federal government and push it to the right if Trump wins the White House. She is also part of an administration that is taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to happen. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier. TRUMP: The former president has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, despite his close ties to many of its key architects. He has nonetheless pledged to undertake his own overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for blocking his first-term agenda, saying: 'I will totally obliterate the deep state.' He plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He says he would then act to fire 'rogue bureaucrats,' including those who 'weaponized our justice system,' and the 'warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.' Trump has pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission. As part of his effort to cut government waste and red tape, he has promised to eliminate at least 10 federal regulations for every new one imposed. HARRIS: Trying to defuse GOP criticism, Harris has said she would sign into law a bipartisan Senate compromise killed by Republican lawmakers at Trump's request. It would have toughened asylum standards and meant more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers. She said she would bring back that bill and sign it, saying that Trump 'talks the talk, but doesn't walk the walk' on immigration. Harris likes to talk up her experience as California attorney general, saying she walked drug smuggler tunnels and successfully prosecuted gangs that moved narcotics and people across the U.S.-Mexico border. Early in his term, Biden made Harris his administration's point person on the root causes of migration. Trump and top Republicans now blame Harris for a situation at that border, which they say is out of control due to policies that were too lenient. Harris has endorsed a comprehensive immigration overhaul, seeking paths to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who arrived as children. TRUMP: He has returned to the harsh immigration rhetoric that marked his previous campaigns. He promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history, an operation that could involve detention camps and the National Guard. He would bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42, which placed curbs on migrants on public health grounds. He has called for the death penalty for any migrant who kills a U.S. citizen. Trump would revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel, Trump pledged new 'ideological screening' for immigrants to bar 'dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs.' He would try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor 'jihadist sympathies.' He would seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally. HARRIS: Harris says Israel has a right to defend itself, and she's repeatedly decried Hamas as a terrorist organization. But the vice president might have helped defuse some backlash from progressives by being more vocal about the need to better protect civilians during fighting in Gaza. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count, but says that women and children make up just over half of the dead. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 militants in the war. Like Biden, Harris supports a proposed hostage-for-extended cease-fire deal that aims to bring all remaining hostages and Israeli dead home. Biden and Harris say the deal could lead to a permanent end to the war and they have endorsed a two-state solution, which would have Israel existing alongside an independent Palestinian state. But Biden is also confronting the prospect of a widening conflict in Lebanon and attacks by Iran even as they both see Israel's recent killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar as a reason for a cease-fire to be more likely. TRUMP: He has expressed support for Israel's efforts to 'destroy' Hamas, but he's also been critical of some of Israel's tactics. He says the country must finish the job quickly and get back to peace. He has called for more aggressive responses to pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses and applauded police efforts to clear encampments. Trump also proposes to revoke the student visas of those who espouse antisemitic or anti-American views and deport those who support Hamas. HARRIS: During her rallies, Harris accuses Trump and his party of seeking to roll back a long list of freedoms, including the ability 'to love who you love openly and with pride.' She leads audiences in chants of 'We're not going back.' While her campaign has yet to produce specifics on its plans, she has been part of a Biden administration that regularly denounces discrimination and attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Early in Biden's term, his administration reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service. His Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX, the 1972 law protecting women's rights, also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes. TRUMP: He has pledged to keep transgender women out of women's sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that 'only two genders,' as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States. He promises to 'defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.' As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he would declare that any health care provider participating in the 'chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth' no longer meets federal health and safety standards and is barred from receiving federal money. He would take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who 'suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body.' Trump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service. NATO and Ukraine HARRIS: The vice president has yet to specify how her positions on Russia's war with Ukraine might differ from Biden's, other than to praise his efforts to rebuild alliances unraveled by Trump, particularly NATO, the military alliance that is a critical bulwark against Russian aggression. The Biden administration has pledged unceasing support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion. Washington has sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine, including $61 billion in weapons, ammunition and other assistance that is expected to last through the end of this year. The government has also reached an agreement with allies to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan — with $20 billion from the United States — that would be backed by frozen Russian financial assets. The administration has maintained that continuing U.S. assistance is critical because Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine. Harris has said previously that it would be foolish to risk global alliances the U.S. has established and decried Putin's 'brutality.' TRUMP: The former president has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and says he will continue to 'fundamentally reevaluate' the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office. He has claimed, without explanation, that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table. (His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire.) On NATO, he has assailed member nations for years for failing to meet agreed-upon military spending targets. Trump drew alarms this year when he said that, as president, he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don't hit those targets, but that he also 'would encourage' Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' to countries that are 'delinquent.' Tariffs and trade HARRIS: The Biden-Harris administration has tried to boost trade with allies in Europe, Asia and North America, while using tariffs and other targeted tools to go after rivals such as China. The Democratic administration kept Trump's tariffs on China in place, while adding a ban on exporting advanced computer chips to that country and providing incentives to boost U.S. industries. In May, the administration specifically targeted China with increased tariffs on electric vehicles and steel and aluminum, among other products. TRUMP: He wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs on nearly all imported foreign goods, saying that 'we're going to have 10% to 20% tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years.' He has suggested tariffs of 100% or more on Chinese goods. He treats these taxes as a way to fund other tax cuts, lower the deficit and possibly fund child care — though economists say the tariffs could raise prices for consumers without generating the revenues Trump promises. Trump would urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China. Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of essential goods including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals and wants to ban Chinese companies from owning U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and farmland. HARRIS: With much of the 2017 tax overhaul expiring at end of next year, Harris is pledging tax cuts for more than 100 million working and middle class households. In addition to preserving some of the expiring cuts, she wants to make permanent a tax credit of as much as $3,600 per child and offer a special $6,000 tax credit for new parents. Harris says her administration would expand tax credits for first-time homebuyers and would push to build 3 million new housing units in four years, while wiping out taxes on tips and endorsing tax breaks for entrepreneurs. Like Biden, she wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum tax to 21%. The current corporate rate is 21% and the corporate minimum, raised under the Inflation Reduction Act, is at 15% for companies making more than $1 billion a year. But Harris would not increase the capital gains tax as much as Biden had proposed on investors with more than $1 million in income. TRUMP: Trump has promised a slew of new tax cuts aimed at groups he has been trying to win over this election, including eliminating taxes on tips received by workers — a policy later embraced by Harris, who would also raise the minimum wage for tipped workers. Trump wants to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits and taxes on overtime pay, and has pledged to make interest on car loans tax-deductible like mortgage payments -– but only for cars built in the U.S. The former president has promised to extend and even expand all of the 2017 tax cuts that he signed into law, while also paying down the debt. He has proposed cutting the overall corporate tax rate to 15% from 21%, but only for companies that make their products in the U.S. He would repeal any tax increases signed into law by Biden. He also aims to gut some of the tax breaks that Biden put into law to encourage the development of renewable energy and EVs. He wants to lower the cost of housing by opening up federal land to development. Outside analyses suggest that Trump's ideas would do much more to increase budget deficits than what Harris would do, without delivering the growth needed to minimize any additional debt.

"Britain's foreign minister David Lammy said he had spoken to his Israeli and Iranian counterparts in separate calls on Sunday seeking to avoid escalation into a ""catastrophic"" regional war after Israel struck Iranian military sites. ""Today I held important calls with Israeli FM (Israel Katz) and Iranian FM (Abbas Araghchi). The UK continues to press for de-escalation and an end to the conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza,"" Lammy said in a statement after a Israeli air attack early on Saturday against Iranian targets. ""A regional war would be catastrophic and is in no one's interests,"" he said.",
"Three journalists were killed in Lebanon by an Israeli strike on Friday morning, drawing condemnation from rights advocates about the number of reporters who have lost their lives in the region over the past year. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it ""strongly condemned"" the attack, urging the international community to ""stop Israel's long-standing pattern of impunity in journalist killings"". The strike around 3 am local time hit a collection of guesthouses housing only reporters in the southern Lebanese town of Hasbaya, killing two journalists from the Al-Mayadeen television network and one journalist from Al-Manar. Muhammad Farhat, a reporter with Lebanese broadcaster Al-Jadeed, was one of at least 18 journalists staying at the guesthouses in Hasbaya. There was no evacuation order by Israel's military. Farhat told Reuters he had been woken up by the sound of Israeli jets flying low overhead and heard two missiles strike nearby guesthouses before the roof of his guesthouse collapsed on him. ""The scenes were terrifying. We saw our colleagues and friends cut up, their limbs strewn all over, others were screaming and begging us to pull them out,"" Farhat said later on Al-Jadeed, tears in his eyes. The Israeli military said it had received reports that journalists had been hit several hours after its forces had attacked what it described as a Hezbollah military structure in Hasbaya, adding that the incident was under review. The last year has been the deadliest period for journalists in more than 30 years, CPJ has said, with at least 126 reporters and media workers among nearly 45,000 people killed in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Lebanon. Two Israeli journalists were killed in the Oct. 7 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that sparked the war. Friday was the deadliest day for journalists in Lebanon over the last year. At least five other reporters have been killed in Israeli strikes while on assignment in Lebanon, including Reuters visuals journalist Issam Abdallah. Sharing a post about Friday's strike on X, the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression Irene Khan wrote: ""Deliberate killing of a journalist is a war crime."" Israel denies deliberately targeting journalists. Mazen Shaqoura, the representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for the Middle East, told Al-Jadeed the strike represented ""a targeting of what we hear and what we see.""",
"Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran damaged at least two secret military bases that allegedly helped produce the missiles Tehran used in its attacks on the Jewish state earlier this year, according to satellite photos. The Planet Labs pictures show extensive damage to both the Parchin and Khojir military bases, located southeast of Tehran, according to an Associated Press analysis. The Parchin base, which was once linked to Iran's nuclear weapons program, suffered significantly more damage, with an entire building demolished by the Israeli attack early Saturday. Iraq's Parchin base, shown a month before the attack, was once linked to the country's nuclear weapons program. AP Advertisement The Albright's Institute for Science and International Security identified the Parchin building that was destroyed as the 'Taleghan 2' facility, where Iran once allegedly conducted explosives tests on uranium cores. It remains unclear if any equipment tied to the nuclear program remained at Parchin after the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) move to access the site in 2011. The satellite photos also show clear damage to at least two buildings at the Khojir base, where experts have warned of a hidden underground tunnel facility that houses some of Iran's missile production sites. Advertisement Burned fields were also spotted near the Tange Bijar natural gas production site in Ilam, one of the three provinces Iran confirmed were hit in the attack, but it was unclear if the damage was a result of the Israeli strike. Damages were also sighted at the Khojir military base, which has been accused of harboring ballistic missile production facilities. AP The Jewish state said it avoided attacking any of Iran's oil and nuclear facilities following warnings from the US and Gulf nations that such an attack would likely trigger all-out war in the Middle East. Rafael Mariano Grossi, who leads the IAEA, confirmed that 'Iran's nuclear facilities have not been impacted' by Friday's strike. Advertisement Along with Parchin and Khojir, Israeli officials said they hit several of the warehouses and buildings Iran had used to build its ballistic missile arsenal, which it employed to attack Israel earlier this month and in April. The Israeli attack appeared to be centered around Ilam, as well as the Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, Tehran said. Iranian officials said the attack killed four soldiers, as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that his nation would retaliate against Israel. With Post wires",
"Talk about early voting: Ronald Reagan won the race for the White House 60 years ago. As columnist George Will quipped, 'it just took 16 years to count the votes.' With just one week before the November 1964 presidential election, Ronald Reagan took to television to make his case for Republican poresidential candidate Barry Goldwater. In Los Angeles, Reagan recorded a 30-minute campaign ad, broadcast nationwide on Oct. 27. His address was pre-recorded but presented as if a live broadcast. The program was 'A Time for Choosing,' but often referred to as simply 'The Speech,' because its impact changed the trajectory of Reagan's life. In today's parlance, Reagan went viral. Reagan began The Speech saying he had spent most of his life as a Democrat but now saw fit to follow another course. He made the case for smaller government, that government is beholden to the people and Americans should reject the intellectual elite in any far-distant capital. The election was about choosing between less government control and more individual freedoms. He had disgust for the fiscal irresponsibility that eroded the purchasing power of a dollar. Reagan was aghast the debt ceiling had been raised three times in 1964 and the country spent 10 times more on welfare than it did during the Great Depression. He criticized the United Nations and foreign aid, claiming the billions sent abroad built more bureaucracy and were used to buy a yacht for Ethiopia's emperor, dress suits for Greek undertakers and extra wives for Kenyan government officials. In total, Reagan claimed, 107 countries received aid from the United States. Today, 210 foreign countries and regions receive assistance from American taxpayers. The debt ceiling has been raised 70 times since 1964. Reagan spent a good deal of time attacking the bloated federal government, bureaucratic overreach and property seizures. He said each day the government spent $17 million more than it collected. Today, the overspend is $4.6 billion a day. Farm subsidies were also the enemy of free enterprise and an insult to the intelligent farmer. Reagan claimed the bureaucracy is so thick the Department of Agriculture has one employee for every 30 farms. Today, there is one employee for every 19 farms. His speech praised the benefits of individual liberties and how the country must always stand up for freedom and be willing to pay its price. Reagan despised communism and revered freedom. 'Should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs?' Reagan asked, 'Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world?' He concluded saying Goldwater had faith in America, and Americans have a rendezvous with destiny, for the United States is the last best hope of man on earth. The broadcast concluded with an appeal for campaign funds. Money was collected the old-fashioned way — flooding a P.O. box in Los Angeles. About $1 million was raised, a staggering sum, considering the combined Democratic-Republican presidential campaigns spent $20 million in the 1960 contest. Reagan's performance was noticed immediately. Just two days after The Speech, a rural Plumas County newspaper wrote about a woman who said Reagan had changed her mind about voting — no vote for Goldwater, she's going to vote for Ronald Reagan! And thus it began. Predictably, Reagan said he had no desire to be a candidate; two weeks later he was studying the opportunity, and finally decided to run for governor, winning two terms. Reagan's Oct. 27 performance was not a hasty campaign whistle-stop; it was the result of relentless practice and discipline. For years, Reagan had been giving The Speech, in different forms and to different audiences. His eight-year contract to host the General Electric Theatre television program allowed him to visit GE factories and boost morale with his public speaking. His remarks hit on the evils of socialism and freedom's blessings. 'A Time for Choosing' evolved from those earlier speeches, such as 1959's 'Business, Ballots and Bureaus.' Reagan warned about the growing power of bureaucrats to shape policy rather than elected lawmakers in Congress. Reagan said stifling regulations are 'frozen into permanency by civil service regulations beyond the reach of any election.' This critique foreshadowed the 2024 Supreme Court overturning of the Chevron Doctrine, a legal principle that allowed federal agencies broad authority to interpret laws. In 1959 and 1960, Reagan delivered the triple-B speech in cities stretching from Chattanooga, Abilene, Spokane and even Honolulu. By 1961, a version of the speech was titled 'Encroaching Control,' where he called California's governor a tower of jelly that sways left with every breeze. He stumped for Nixon's run for governor in 1962 and changed his voter registration to Republican that fall. His speech titles morphed to 'The Price of Freedom' and 'What's at Stake?' but the core messages of fiscal responsibility and democratic freedom remained. Reagan spoke to anyone: Republican clubs, chambers of commerce, sororities, college campuses, realtors, Elks Clubs, Rotary Clubs and Lions Clubs. And he went everywhere. Reagan crisscrossed California from Barstow to Chico speaking under the shortened banner 'Time to Choose.' Each speech could be tailored for the audience. Reagan dropped lines that did not have punch; he added and updated evidence as the data evolved. He studied pace and pause, picking the opportune moment to raise his voice or stay silent to absorb applause or laughter. When Reagan became co-chair of Goldwater's California campaign, he added parts about candidate Goldwater piloting his own airplane to deliver medicine to flood-ravaged Mexico.

Commentary | Obama wrong to denounce Black men for not supporting Kamala Harris Commentary | Throttling artificial intelligence will come back to haunt California A critical test came in July 1964, when Reagan spoke to 5,000 delegates at the Kiwanis convention in Los Angeles. That speech had no title but nearly every word was identical to 'A Time for Choosing.' It was perfect practice for what was to come. The Republican convention was in San Francisco in just two weeks, and with Goldwater trailing in the polls, the campaign would need to muster everything to close the gap. Goldwater is remembered for his 'extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice' phrase during his acceptance speech. The Johnson campaign responded with the 'Daisy' nuclear countdown ad that frightened voters with Goldwater's extremism, stretching Johnson's polling lead. When it came time to record 'A Time for Choosing,' Goldwater's chances were slim, but Reagan was undaunted, as this moment was years in the making. Reagan spoke with a freshness and urgency that beguiled a decade of repetition. Never with a teleprompter, he had delivered countless iterations across thousands of miles, to ally and to foe, and in places big and small. Before Reagan was the Great Communicator, he was the Great Preparer. Political fortunes change abruptly by election, scandal, assassination, or a bad debate night, but rarely by readiness. Far beyond viral luck, that night superior preparation met opportunity.

"Stem cell biologist Jacob Hanna has received a lot of worldwide attention since his team at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel created a synthetic human embryo. He was at a human reproduction conference in Montreal this week to discuss his ground-breaking work. The living structure, made from stem cells cultured in a lab, was created without an egg, sperm, or a womb. The model gives a window into the earliest stage of development when cells are rapidly multiplying. 'I call it the big drama, when a ball of stem cells becomes an organ filled embryo. And the rest of pregnancy is just growth,' he said. The first month is also when most miscarriages happen, and developmental defects occur. Studying this period is almost impossible since embryos are too small to be seen via ultrasound and most countries, including Canada, do not allow embryos in a lab beyond 14 days. To circumvent the technical and ethical constraints, Hanna and his team produced a synthetic model, using stem cells from different species that could be grown in a lab and generate all the components of an embryo, including the placenta and the yolk sac. Sophie Petropoulous, the Canada Research Chair in Functional Genomic of Reproduction and Development, said Hanna's research is already impacting her own work in studying infertility at the Université de Montreal. 'It's really one of the first models that lets us understand the process of implantation and onward to the period that we call the black box, that in the human we don't understand,' she said. While the research in this early period is rapidly developing, there is a push within the scientific community to lift the 14-day restriction, according to Canadian bioethicist Francoise Baylis. 'Now scientists are saying, 'well, why can't I go beyond 14 days?'' Baylis said. 'I can tell you about all the benefits that I could deliver as a scientist if you would let me go beyond 14 days.' But Baylis said that only frames the issue from the scientific standpoint, and not the greater issue of how this impacts humanity. Lifting the restrictions would mean changing laws, and Baylis said the public would have to be involved in any decision making that could have big implications. 'Part of what we're looking at is potentially changing us as a species,' she said. Hanna said he supports ethical constraints but added the work being done in this field could also have life changing benefits such as curing disease and preventing miscarriage.",
"Mohammed Khatib, a Brussels-based Palestinian activist and European coordinator of the terror-designated Samidoun, who was due to give a speech at the Radboud University in Nijmegen in the Netherlands this week, has been banned from entering the country by Dutch authorities. In a joint statement issued by Justice and Security Minister David van Weel and Asylum Minister Marjolein Faber, Khatib's presence in the Netherlands was declared 'highly undesirable,' with the two officials adding that Khatib 'legitimizes, condones and glorifies violence… including violence by organizations on the European Union's terrorist list… [and] also actively expresses his support for terrorist organizations,' warning from the radicalizing effects of his rhetoric.This ban comes only a couple of weeks after both the US and Canada designated his organization Samidoun as a terror group, and follows a motion passed by the Dutch parliament to ban the group as well, which must pass in the government in order to come into effect.In their designation, the US and Canada described Samidoun as fundraising on behalf of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a designated terrorist organization that took part in the murders and taking of hostages during the October 7 massacre, and stood behind the assassination of Rina Shnerb in 2019 and Israeli minister Rehavam Ze'evi in 2001, among others.Khatib is the European coordinator of Samidoun, a group designated by the US, Canada, and Israel as a sham charity group that raised funds for the PFLP and was banned in Germany over its support for violence and jeopardizing of public safety. He was also mentioned as a member of the PFLP himself in several Palestinian and Arabic-speaking outlets.This is not the first time Khatib has been denied entry into a country. In 2017, he was reportedly denied a visa to the US for similar reasons. In this context, it was reported this past year that Khatib was at risk of having his asylum status in Belgium revoked over his activities. Khatib is also known for his ties to terrorist leaders: In 2024, he led and hosted two webinars with Hamas leaders Basem Naim and Husam Badran in his capacity as a leading figure in 'Masar Badil,' another proxy of the PFLP, and Samidoun, which endorses violence and terror and is active across Europe and beyond, showing an extensive relation to these figures. Exposing violent rhetoric Khatib's violent rhetoric was exposed in several instances, including during a 2022 rally where he stood beside operatives dressed as militants from the Lions' Den terror organization in front of the European Parliament in his asylum city of Brussels, calling to bring down the European Union and defeat 'this colonial entity' alongside Israel, Canada, and the US. In another instance in 2023, also in Brussels, he led a protest calling 'Long live the rifle! Long live the Lions' Den!' and lauding the 'resistance in Gaza' as the 'only representative of the Palestinian people,' and rejecting what he deemed the 'bull***t, racist, two-state solution.'Samidoun denounced on its website the decision to ban Khatib from entering the Netherlands:'This repression is another form of support for the genocide and an attempt to shut down every voice of opposition to Dutch complicity with the occupation. Furthermore, the ban is a racist and colonial tool used to limit the freedom of movement of a Palestinian refugee who already cannot enter his homeland. It is also intended as an attack on the Palestinian liberation movement as a whole and specifically on the thousands of Palestinian prisoners struggling and organizing under torture and severe abuse from the Zionist regime inside its colonial jails.'According to a report launched this month by the European Leadership Network (ELNET), the Netherlands is a hotbed for Hamas-related fundraising activity, led by one of its main operators on the continent, Lebanese-born Dutch national Amin Abu Rashed, who was arrested in June last year over suspicions of transferring millions of dollars to Hamas through sham charity groups.",
"The Bitcoin (BTC) market has been significantly disturbed over the last 24 hours following a series of troubling news reports. During this period, the crypto market leader has recorded notable downfalls with its price slipping below the $66,000 price mark. However, a crypto analyst with X username Luca has postulated this recent price decline can be attributed to another factor beyond the news events. Table of Contents Bitcoin Crash Due To Overleveraged Market, Not News Event: Analyst On Friday, the Wall Street Journal Such a damaging report on USDT which ranks as the largest stablecoin appeared to induce a bearish sentiment in the crypto market which caused BTC to fall to around $66,000 prior to a refuting statement by Tether's management. While in partial recovery, reports of an Israeli attack on Iran also ignited another downtrend forcing Bitcoin to reach a local bottom of $65,700. Overall, BTC's dropped by 4% from around $68,602 on Friday. However, in an The crypto analyst explains that amidst Bitcoin's downtrend, Open Interest also dropped by 9% indicating the market was highly overleveraged. According to Luca, BTC's recent rally from $59,000 on October 10th to $69,000 on October 21st was driven by Perpetual contracts with little to no spot investment. Thus, the rally was always temporary with significant liquidations and price reversal a certainty. Is BTC Headed To $60,000? In regards to the high Open Interest in Bitcoin, Luca also states that the Liquidation Heatmap has shown significant liquidations to occur at purported support zones as these positions are highly overleveraged. Following the recent price drop, the analyst highlights that $65,000, which represents a major support level, is one of these highly overleveraged zones with several long positions. Luca believes the Bitcoin bulls will lose this support zone if a retest occurs and BTC is likely to fall to $60,000 which may now hold as an effective support level. At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade at $67,001 with a 0.50% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the asset's daily trading volume is down by 28.23% and valued at $26.93 billion.

"A Jewish community event in London was protested by a large group of anti-Israeli activists on Sunday, in an incident that reportedly took the Met Police two hours to resolve. The protesters - numbering about 150 according to Jewish News - stood outside the JW3 building in Finchley, where an event organized by Israeli left-leaing newspaper Haaretz was taking place. The protesters held up signs with slogans such as ""Israel burns children alive,"" chanted that Israelis were ""mass murderers,"" and demanded the end to the ""occupation."" Blood libel outside Jewish community centre in north London. @metpoliceuk sanctioned this. pic.twitter.com/bZ8BmdaorK — Hannah BRING THEM HOME (@nice_cuppa) October 27, 2024 In a video on X, the pro-Palestine crowd repeats the words of one protester who can be heard saying: 'We will continue to occupy these streets every day of the week, no matter how many police… until Zionism no longer exists in the Middle East because Zionism is a racist ideology.' The Metropolitan Police announced that they were dealing with a ""protest"" but did not specify that the event being targeted was a Jewish one. The police added that one person, reportedly on the pro-Palestinian side, was arrested for criminal damage. Someone at the scene told The Jerusalem Post that they saw an anti-Israel activist remove a yellow ribbon tied in memory of the Gaza hostages and wear it around their neck. The source added that they had also seen messages in the WhatsApp group of the protest organizers saying ""we could do with more numbers as Zios coming.""

The event being protested - the Haaretz Conference - featured diverse voices, including, among others, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Former Fatah foreign minister Dr Nasser Alkidwa, an activist whose parents were murdered on October 7, and a consultant surgeon who worked in Gaza. Policing failure The Board of Deputies of British Jews said that the choice of protest location outside a key Jewish community center served as proof of an ""ongoing effort, carried out under the guise of humanitarian concern, to harass and intimidate British Jews."" ""Far too many people have decided to turn a blind eye to the hideous behavior exhibited at such protests,"" the Board added. The Board also stressed the need for more stringent and more proactive policing, in order to protect the Jewish community. Stop The Hate UK called it another failure by the Met Police and drew attention to one of the protesters who allegedly had been arrested previously on 5 October following hate speech and gestures. ""Yet again, @metpoliceuk is failing to protect the Jewish community in London. Today, they allow the terrorist supporters to spread their hate and antisemitism in north London opposite a peace conference organized by @Haaretz."" Another source at the scene told The Post that police presence at the protest was minimal, numbering around 20 officers. The police officers allegedly sat in their cars rather than confronting the anti-Israel mob.",
"BAALBEK: Since war erupted between Israel and Hezbollah, the famed Palmyra Hotel in e ast Lebanon's Baalbek has been without visitors, but long-time employee Rabih Salika refuses to leave — even as bombs drop nearby. The hotel, which was built in 1874, once welcomed renowned guests including former French President Charles de Gaulle and American singer Nina Simone. Overlooking a large archeological complex encompassing the ruins of an ancient Roman town, the Palmyra has kept its doors open through several conflicts and years of economic collapse. 'This hotel hasn't closed its doors for 150 years,' Salika said, explaining that it welcomed guests at the height of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war and during Israel's last war with Hezbollah in 2006. The 45-year-old has worked there for more than half his life and says he will not abandon it now. 'I'm very attached to this place,' he said, adding that the hotel's vast, desolate halls leave 'a huge pang in my heart.' He spends his days dusting decaying furniture and antique mirrors. He clears glass shards from windows shattered by strikes. Baalbek, known as the 'City of the Sun' in ancient times, is home to one of the world's largest complex of Roman temples — designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. But the latest Israel-Hezbollah war has cast a pall over the eastern city, home to an estimated 250,000 people before the war. After a year of cross-border clashes with Hezbollah, Israel last month ramped-up strikes on the group's strongholds, including parts of Baalbek. Only about 40 percent of Baalbek's residents remain in the city, local officials say, mainly crammed into the city's few Sunni-majority districts. On Oct. 6, Israeli strikes fell hundreds of meters (yards) away from the Roman columns that bring tourists to the city and the Palmyra hotel. UNESCO told AFP it was 'closely following the impact of the ongoing crisis in Lebanon on the cultural heritage sites.' More than a month into the war, a handful of Baalbek's shops remain open, albeit for short periods of time. 'The market is almost always closed. It opens for one hour a day, and sometimes not at all,' said Baalbek Mayor Mustafa Al-Shall. Residents shop for groceries quickly in the morning, rarely venturing out after sundown. They try 'not to linger on the streets fearing an airstrike could hit at any moment,' he said. Last year, nearly 70,000 tourists and 100,000 Lebanese visited Baalbek. But the city has only attracted five percent of those figures so far this year, the mayor said. Even before the war, local authorities in Baalbek were struggling to provide public services due to a five-year economic crisis. Now municipality employees are mainly working to clear the rubble from the streets and provide assistance to shelters housing the displaced. A Baalbek hospital was put out of service by a recent Israeli strike, leaving only five other facilities still fully functioning, Shall said. Baalbek resident Hussein Al-Jammal said the war has turned his life upside down. 'The streets were full of life, the citadel was welcoming visitors, restaurants were open, and the markets were crowded,' the 37-year-old social worker said. 'Now, there is no one.' His young children and his wife have fled the fighting, but he said he had a duty to stay behind and help those in need. 'I work in the humanitarian field, I cannot leave, even if everyone leaves,' he said. Only four homes in his neighborhood are still inhabited, he said, mostly by vulnerable elderly people. 'I pay them a visit every morning to see what they need,' he said, but 'it's hard to be away from your family.' Rasha Al-Rifai, 45, provides psychological support to women facing gender-based violence. But in the month since the war began, she has lost contact with many. 'Before the war ... we didn't worry about anything,' said Rifai, who lives with her elderly parents. 'Now everything has changed, we work remotely, we don't see anyone, most of the people I know have left.' 'In the 2006 war we were displaced several times, it was a very difficult experience, we don't want this to happen again,' she said. 'We will stay here as long as it is bearable.'",
"The United Nations Security Council is expected to meet on Monday to discuss Israel's attack on Iran, diplomats said on Sunday. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi called on the Security Council to meet over the attack and diplomats said the council was likely to discuss the situation on Monday. 'Israeli regime's actions constitute a grave threat to international peace and security and further destabilize an already fragile region,"" Araqchi said in a letter to the 15-member council on Saturday. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran, in alignment with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and under international law, reserves its inherent right to legal and legitimate response to these criminal attacks at the appropriate time,' he wrote. Scores of Israeli jets completed three waves of strikes before dawn on Saturday against missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran, Israel's military said. It was retaliation for Iran's Oct. 1 attack on Israel with about 200 ballistic missiles, and Israel warned its heavily armed arch-foe not to hit back after the latest strike. Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon rejected Iran's complaint at the United Nations, saying in a statement on Sunday that Iran was ""trying to act against us in the diplomatic arena with the ridiculous claim that Israel has violated international law."" ""As we have stated time and time again, we have the right and duty to defend ourselves and will use all the means at our disposal to protect the citizens of Israel,"" Danon said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed 'to all parties to cease all military actions, including in Gaza and Lebanon, exert maximum efforts to prevent an all-out regional war and return to the path of diplomacy,' his spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday.",
